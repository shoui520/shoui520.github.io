However, this is in fact, false. First, let's consider just exactly why this argument exists in the first place. Usually when people say this, they don't know why the argument exists anyway, in other words, most people saying this don't know what they're talking about. The argument comes from the fact that if you learn Japanese using anime, you will think, \"\u304a\u3044\u3001\u3066\u3081\u3047\u306a\u306b\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff01\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\" and \"\u3061\u3063\u3001\u30aa\u30e9\u3041\u4e00\u756a\u5f37\u3047\u3093\u3060\u305c\", \"\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\u4f55\u30d6\u30c4\u30d6\u30c4\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff1f\u6253\u3063\u6bba\u3059\u305e\uff01\" is natural. (Just imagine some very cringe and rude things if you cant read it haha) In actual fact, this is not true at all. It is important to remember that every anime is different, some speak more natural than others, some may sound more masculine than others, some may sound more feminine than others. For example, \"Kimi no Na wa.\" is more natural than \"Dragon Ball Z\". And \"Love Live!\" is more natural than \"Kill la Kill\". In anime such as \"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Ren'ai Zunousen\", each character speaks different. Some characters speak like an \"anime\", while others actually sound pretty natural. Second, please take time to think: \"What is \"real\" Japanese?\"</p>"},{"location":"animejp/#real-japanese","title":"\"Real\" Japanese","text":"<p>Anime is often argued to be not \"real\" Japanese. People arguing this only say this because it is different from the artificial, watered-down mess they learn in the textbooks. In fact, textbook Japanese is very unnatural, and can be argued that it is not \"real\" Japanese. There's many forms of Japanese. Just like how there are many forms of English. Do you speak in the same exact way as someone else you know? Probably not. But does this mean they are wrong and their English is not \"real\"? Absolutely not.  Each person is unique to their own idiolects, different places have their own dialects, and so on. There are billions of different kinds of Japanese, so much so that it is not possible to point to a single form of Japanese and say that that one is the \"real\" Japanese. Anime in fact, is actually sometimes pretty natural, when I have conversations with Japanese friends what they say is close to what I've heard in anime before.

Japanese made by a NATIVE FOR NATIVES. Anime is scripted by natives. Movies are scripted by natives. J-Drama is scripted by natives. These content are made for Japanese people, and aren't necessarily intended for learning but surprisingly they are an incredibly powerful tool for learning. Textbooks, although they may be written by a native, they are made for foreigners. The Japanese gets watered down, artificial and filtered, for foreigners.

Older anime sometimes have unusual, outdated slang, take for example, \"\u30c0\u30c1\" slang for a friend is pretty outdated by today and would sound funny if you said it to a Japanese person.  Anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e yakuwarigo (role language), where the use of language is changed to fit how the character is like. For example, the anime villain may say \u8cb4\u69d8 kisama, or \u3066\u3081\u3047 a lot of the time, but anyone with a brain would know they shouldn't talk like that guy, so you won't end up saying it to a Japanese person. Because anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e, you will get a broad sense of immersion which means you would know what sounds masculine, what sounds feminine, arrogant, polite, sarcastic etc. Which makes it a very valuable immersion resource.

Please note that the usages of these are not consistent. So I can\u2019t really say for sure. Hiragana is used for words not written in kanji (such as \u3053\u3068 which also has a kanji form \u4e8b), whatever sticks out at the end of a verb (e.g. \u5473\u308f\u3046, \u639b\u3051\u308b. \u602f\u3080), things like \u201c\u3060\u308d\u3046, \u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u201d, particles (such as \u3092\u3001\u306e\u3001\u306f\u3001\u306b\u3001\u304c\u3001\u3067 etc.), someone's name (like \u3086\u307f, this can also be in kanji too because like I said it\u2019s not consistent). Katakana is mainly used for foreign/imported words such as \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 (communication from English), \u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30b2\u30f3 (R\u00f6ntgen from German), \u30aa\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc\u30c8 (oblaat from Dutch). But katakana is used in \u64ec\u97f3\u8a9e (giongo, onomatopoeic word). There are a lot of these in Japanese. But not all giongo are written in katakana, things like \u3042\u3063\u3055\u308a are almost always in hiragana, things like \u30b4\u30ef\u30b4\u30ef are more likely to be in katakana. A change in nuance perhaps? Katakana can also be used for foreign names. Kanji is used when it is used. Yes. Kanji is used when it\u2019s used.

You'll hear everyone say something along those lines when asked about their learning goals. However, many also fail to reach these goals even after years of study. Is the language just too hard? Are they just not studying hard enough?</p> <p>I believe it's actually not their fault, but rather the method's. In language learning, the method behind your learning makes a huge difference in the kind of progress you make.</p> <p>As it turns out, reaching such goals is not possible with \"traditional\" methods of Japanese learning. Many students are led to failure for not including a crucial ingredient, immersion, into their study routines. Immersion refers to listening to or reading native content made for native speakers. For example, anime is originally in Japanese without subtitles, so when consumed in this form, we call it immersion.   </p>"},{"location":"guide/#12-problems-with-traditional-methods","title":"1.2 Problems with traditional methods","text":"<p>A Japanese learner following a \u201ctraditional\u201d study method would usually go through the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Learning the alphabet(s).</li> <li>Learning basic sentences such as greetings and self-introductions.</li> <li>Learning basic grammar structure and vocabulary.</li> <li>Coming up with sentences either by having conversations with a tutor or study partner, or by writing.</li> <li>Translating example sentences from their native language to their target language and vice versa.</li> <li>Looking up further material about grammar structures and vocabulary in textbooks or YouTube videos recommended by a tutor.</li> <li>Practising conversation using knowledge from their study.</li> <li>Accumulating more vocabulary and grammar structures, which becomes a measure of one\u2019s own progress</li> <li>And finally, in the endgame, moving to or visiting Japan in hopes of having opportunities to practise their skills.</li> </ul> <p>None of that is bad in itself, it is actually sufficient study, but it's not enough to get you to a high level of proficiency. The problem is they aren't actually engaging with the real language\u2014but what do I mean by that?</p> <p>Let's take swimming as an example. You can't just stay in the baby pool with floaters and take your time to become a pro at the baby pool before attempting to swim in a real pool. This won\u2019t make you a good swimmer. You also can't expect to become a good swimmer just by learning the theory behind the techniques in isolation and practising them without actually swimming in a real pool.</p> <p>How about a more relatable example: competitive video games. You won\u2019t get better at the game just playing against the AI and grinding in training mode all day. You have to play the real game against other people even if you think you\u2019re going to lose by a landslide. This is \"playing the real game\", with no strings attached.  </p>    It's important to learn how to move on!  <p>A common trap students fall into in language learning is staying on beginner resources for too long.  </p> <p>They want to ensure they know every single detail of their basics and refuse to move on to the real language. They refuse to engage in anything they aren't already comfortable with, because they're too afraid of not understanding anything. They may feel like they aren't \u201cready\". Yet it\u2019s important to leave your beginner resources as soon as possible because, in reality, you will never be ready until you actually start engaging with the real language and get yourself used to it.  </p> <p>Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword in language learning. As a perfectionist myself, I've suffered more than I've gained wanting to make sure I've gotten every single detail down of trivial things that didn't really matter in the big picture.  </p> <p>Learning a language is like climbing a mountain. You can try to climb that mountain without anything assisting your ascent, and though it will take lots of struggle, you will eventually make it if you persist. Traditional study is like building a rope so that it's easier to climb that mountain, but you can't climb the mountain just by making a rope! You eventually have to climb it, because no matter how much rope you decide to make climbing that mountain is still going to be difficult and time-consuming.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#13-the-scale-of-language","title":"1.3 The scale of language","text":"<p>Language is\u2026 huge. There's so much to it that far exceeds the limitations of a classroom or app-based approach that tries to teach in an \"x means y\" or \"x does y\" format. Mastering a language to a higher level requires enormous amounts of experience reading and listening to what native speakers say.</p> <p>It's often difficult to grasp why they tend to use that phrase in this context, or this word instead of that other one\u2026 This creates a barrier for us learners as we can't just study grammar and vocabulary to achieve native-like fluency.</p> <p>Without the prerequisite experience, attempting to construct sentences in your target language often leads to unnatural, or difficult to understand phrasing. In turn, lack of experience with how native speakers use their language makes it difficult to understand them, due to unfamiliarity with phrasing outside of a learning resource's scope.</p> <p>This is why in your learning routine, you do what we call \"immersion\"\u2014read and listen to what natives write and speak.</p> <p>Language learning is a process of subconsciously memorising patterns with comprehensible input. What this means is, when you understand something (comprehensible) in your immersion (input), your brain subconsciously stores that pattern for later information retrieval. You see, being able to comfortably read this guide is only possible because you have so much experience reading English in the past that, when you read this, your brain thinks something like, \"Oh, there's pattern #234 used with pattern #82 and pattern #10!\".    </p> <p>And since you are a proficient English reader, this is done effortlessly. You can understand the words in these sentences. You can understand what links the sentences together. You can even detect the tone and degree of formality in my writing, and it's all thanks to your brain storing the context, and other information of all the language patterns that you've come across.</p> <p>Notice how I haven't mentioned \"knowing the grammar\" or \"having memorised the vocabulary\"?

That's ridiculous.  </p>    Kanji aren't words, but they make up the building blocks.    <p>Japanese has extra steps when it comes to learning how to read; due to kanji you need to constantly refer to a dictionary to learn how to read anything at all. Take this for example, if I showed you the word, \u4eca\u65e5, chances are you wouldn't be able to read it, or know what it means. How you learn how to read it is by looking it up in a dictionary, such as Jisho.org. The dictionary shows it is read as \u304d\u3087\u3046, and means today.

What do you do if you don\u2019t have access to comprehensible input? As a complete beginner, there is no content that is easy. In fact, this is why people often fall into the endless cycle of reading from beginner resource to beginner resource.

While output won't directly improve your proficiency at the language, it is still quite important to be practicing output, whether it is by texting or with speech, because input and output go hand in hand. Doing output effectively forces your brain to make sure it is correctly understanding the words you are hearing and you may start to subconsciously look for opportunities to use what you hear in input. Regular output along with regular input is recommended.     </p> <p>Contrary to what many immersion-based learning methods say, I do not believe it is a smart idea to delay your output until you are \"really good\" for reasons such as \"saying things incorrectly is going to \"cripple\" or \"ruin\" your Japanese\".

Well for most of them, they don't even want to try outputting at all because they're scared of saying something broken, or scared that it's going to ruin their Japanese, or scared that somebody may laugh at them etc. All of this is a product of a toxic perfectionist mindset that hurts immersion learning.  </p>"},{"location":"guide/#32-pronunciation-pitch-accent","title":"3.2 Pronunciation &amp; Pitch Accent","text":"<p>Compared to language communities and resources for literally every other language out there, Japanese resources, tutors and learners always tend to make pronunciation an afterthought because Japanese pronunciation is simple.

These are known as full-width characters. As the name suggests, they are wide and are designed to accomodate the width of Japanese characters, which are wider than Latin characters. This allows for a cleaner look consistent with Japanese standards. You can see this clearly demonstrated here: <code>\u3042\u3044\u3046\u3048\u304a\uff21\uff22\uff23\uff24\uff25\uff26ABCDEF</code> Full width characters can be only be typed in the \u3042 mode, and you can type them holding Shift then typing before an edit, or press F9 during an edit.  </p> <p>Feel free to experiment with the IME yourself in Copilot or Notepad!  </p>  Microsoft IME Cheatsheet  <p>A basic cheatsheet for the Microsoft IME on a non-JIS keyboard is as follows:  </p> <p>Finish and commit edit: Enter Discard current edit: Esc Convert, or press again to select a different candidate: Space Autocomplete, or cycle through candidates: Tab Navigate candidates: Up and Down or number keys for quick selection Switch between hiragana and Direct Input: Alt` Convert to hiragana: F6 Convert to katakana: F7 Convert to half-width katakana: F8 Convert to full-width romaji: F9 Convert to romaji: F10 Redo conversion: Win/ Undo last edit: CtrlZ Change back to hiragana (not applicable if edits are committed): CtrlBackspace Search candidate with Bing: CtrlB Type Yen symbol: Type <code>\u3048\u3093</code> and find <code>\u00a5</code> in the conversion candidates. Type any symbol: Type Japanese reading and find it in the conversion candidates. E.g. <code>\u3089\u3080\u3060</code> can give you the greek symbol <code>\u03bb</code>, <code>\u307d\u3093\u3069</code> can give you the British pound symbol <code>\u00a3</code>. <code>\u307f\u304e</code> can give you <code>\u2192</code>. etc.  </p> <p>By default, the Japanese IME  will use the English US keyboard layout (ShiftNum 2 = <code>@</code>). The only other officially supported option is the JIS keyboard layout, which you can switch to by changing your hardware keyboard layout for the IME to Japanese keyboard (106/109 key) and restarting your PC.

Learning the first stroke of \u30c1 (katakana) can be applied to \u79c1 which can be applied to \u9999 and \u99a8. This isn't the same thing as RTK, that's different, but similar. It all connects. Of course, for awkward characters like \u98db you might need to look up the stroke order.

Unfortunately, even if you literally know the word and the stroke order of the kanji that compose the word, it is very likely that when it actually comes to writing the word, you won't be able to recall how to write it. This problem can be overcome by individually learning how to write each word. You can do this by writing out sentences (don't write isolated words, write sentences, this helps with proportions). However, the utility value of this can be disputed. With today's technology, do you really need to learn how to write all those words? Probably not. You can just input it into your IME.  With this said, consider your priorities, if you work in Japan and need to write Japanese as a part of your job this will obviously be essential for you. If not, then personally I don't see the point.

A monolingual dictionary is a dictionary that defines words of the language in that language. For example, the Oxford Dictionary is a monolingual English dictionary. The K\u014djien (\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1) is a monolingual Japanese dictionary. Sites such as Jisho.org use the Japanese-English bilingual dictionary known as \u201cJMdict (English)\u201d.

You may not think so, but I\u2019ve been using monolingual dictionaries for a long time now and I can confirm bilingual definitions (especially those from the JMdict) do not capture the true feel of the word. Here\u2019s an example: </p> <p>\u6094\u3057\u3044 [\u304f\u3084\u3057\u3044]  </p> <p>If you have been learning Japanese for a few months, you would know this word.

It\u2019s so vague to the point that it is literally wrong. Now let\u2019s look at the monolingual definition.</p> <p>Taken from the Hybrid Shinjirin (\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797)</p> <p>\u5931\u6557\u3084\u6065\u8fb1\u3092\u7d4c\u9a13\u3057\u3066\uff0c\u3042\u304d\u3089\u3081\u305f\u308a\u5fd8\u308c\u305f\u308a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3055\u307e\u3002</p> <p>My translation of the definition:</p> <p>Go through failure and dishonour and not being able to give up nor forget (about it).</p> <p>And this gets less accurate when you put it into English.</p> <p>Did you get that from \u201cvexing, annoying\u201d? No. Probably not.</p> <p>Not convinced? Let\u2019s go through another example.</p> <p>\u60aa\u3044 [\u308f\u308b\u3044]</p> <p>Let me ask you one thing. What do you think this word means? If you answered, \u201cbad\u201d. Then you\u2019re only half wrong. This word is not equal to the English word \u201cbad\u201d.</p> <p>You can\u2019t use \u60aa\u3044 to say that your skill at something is inferior/poor, like you can in English. You use a completely different word in Japanese, and that\u2019s \u4e0b\u624b [\u3078\u305f]. See? And this is only scratching the surface of this problem.</p> <p>The other reason why you should use monolingual definitions is because they help you think in Japanese. Like I said before, there is no language that can express Japanese as well as Japanese itself can. Dictionary definitions are a way of thinking about words. I\u2019m sure dictionary authors (who are native speakers) put thought into each of their definitions when they wrote their definition, so by reading the definition and memorising it, you will have something at least close to what a native speaker may think of the word. If you learn words using a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary (such as JMdict) then you will have a GAIJIN way of thinking about things, and not even close to what a native may think about the word. This will set you back in getting a true understanding of the word. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can still get a true understanding with immersion, it just takes a lot longer than if you learned those words monolingually.</p> <p>Monolingual dictionaries are very powerful, and you will only realise this once they become second nature to you.</p>"},{"location":"monolingual/#why-people-find-it-hard-to-go-monolingual","title":"Why people find it hard to go monolingual.","text":"<p>Two reasons:  </p> <ul> <li>They don\u2019t know the words.  </li> <li>Are not used to the written Japanese.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"monolingual/#monolingual-transition-myths","title":"Monolingual transition myths","text":"<ul> <li>A profound belief that \"dictionary vocabulary\" exist. </li> </ul> <p>The truth: \u201cDictionary vocabulary\u201d = words you don\u2019t know because you don\u2019t read enough.</p>"},{"location":"monolingual/#using-morphman-to-assist-the-monolingual-transition","title":"Using Morphman to assist the monolingual transition","text":"<p>No.</p> <p>Morphman is an Anki addon (?) which automatically decides what words to add to Anki for you.

If you want guidelines on what to mine, then just mine every single word after you have read/watched it. The idea here is, when you are looking up stuff, it is inevitable you are going to remember some things but forget others, so when you go back and read/watch it again, you mine all the words you failed to remember the first time.

In language acquisition, force feeding yourself too-unfamiliar sentences is not as effective as understanding i+1 sentences. (Only one thing in the sentence that aren't so comfortable with; these \"things\" may not even be identifiable.) When you read more, you will come across a crap ton of sentences, and within these sentences, there will be plenty of i+1 sentences, and this is the peak of your language acquisition gains.

(Any) Non Non Biyori Kimetsu no Yaiba   Koe no Katachi Hotarubi no Mori e   Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo   Himouto! Umaru-chan Nakitai Watashi wa Neko o Kaburu Yuru Yuri Precure (Any) Gabriel Dropout Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight K-on Ao haru Ride Usagi Drop Flying Witch Byousoku 5 Centimeter Kiniro Mosaic New Game  </p> <p>See Anime Resources for places to find anime. Downloading the anime is preferred because it makes it easier to bring the anime portably.  </p> <p>Q: Everything here is so boooooring!!!! I'd rather watch something actually good!</p> <p>A: And I like your way of thinking! Immersion is all about spending time with content that interests you. So please, don't limit yourself to my suggestions.  </p> <p>Your task: </p> <p>I want you to try immersing for the first time with the \"subtitle tutor\" method.  </p> <p>The subtitle tutor method is where you watch an episode of an anime with English subtitles, then watch it again without subtitles. Then listen to it when doing other things (wireless earbuds makes this easier).  </p> <p>The flowchart process:</p> <ol> <li>Watch with English subtitles  </li> <li>Watch without any subtitles (also known as raw listening)  </li> <li>Are you done for today? (Yes=Put the episodes on in the background to listen while you do other things. | No= Go back to step 1.)</li> </ol> <p>Essentially, by watching the episode with subtitles first, you have increased the comprehensibility of your input.  </p> <p>While watching the episode raw, don't worry if you can't understand.  </p> <p>Try to focus on the sounds, the speaking patterns and anything in it that you can make meaning out of.  </p> <p>Becoming able to understand Japanese is a skill that takes a long time.  </p> <p>But it all begins with raw listening and trying to make that listening comprehensible.  </p> <p>The subtitle tutor method is only meant to provide context for the audio you are listening to.   </p> <p>I also recommend listening to the audio when doing other things.  </p> <p>By doing that you are essentially filling in the silence with Japanese, which means, even if for a few seconds, you may pay attention to what's being said.  </p> <p>Note: Listening while doing other things = passive immersion. Listening with undivided attention = active immersion.  </p> <p>Q: Why immersion before any grammar or vocabulary study? </p> <p>A: Some of you might have wondered why I want you to immerse without knowing any grammar or whatever. And that's because listening is the crux of learning a language. Native speakers are so good at their language because of their environment (the language being there wherever they go), and by replicating that environment you can expect to replicate the results. Listening a lot even if you don't understand makes it easier to learn new words in Japanese and get a deeper feel for the language.  </p> <p>Q: So, I've completed my first episode, what should I do now?</p> <p>A: You can consider your immersion done for the day but if you want to do more (which is great) then you can roll a dice to decide how many episodes you want to watch.  </p> <p>Roll a dice </p> <p>I didn't want to overwhelm you on your second day, so you'll start learning about grammar tomorrow.  </p>"},{"location":"routine/#day-3","title":"Day 3","text":""},{"location":"routine/#stage-just-starting-grammar","title":"Stage: Just starting grammar","text":"<p>Do your daily kana practice on this site! https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html for 10 minutes.  </p> <p>Use a timer here: https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/ </p> <p>Now here's where you'll start grammar.  </p> <p>You don't need to do any drills or anything.    </p> <p>You don't need to choose the correct patterns or anything like that.   </p> <p>Everything you will be learning is insanely common and will be reinforced with your daily immersion.     </p> <p>The grammar guide I want you to use is Cure Dolly's Organic Japanese.  </p> <p>The YouTube playlist is here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj </p> <p>For folks out there that prefer reading, here is the Cure Dolly fan-made textbook!  </p> <p>All I want you to do is watch the videos and take notes</p> <p>(Google Keep note taking site here: https://keep.google.com/)  </p> <p>Note: I recommend turning on the subtitles for Cure Dolly's videos. </p> <p>Watch 3 videos a day </p> <p>That is a good number, you will be near the end of her guide after 30 days at that pace.  </p> <p>Take notes. </p> <p>Q: What should I even put in my notes? </p> <p>A: You should put information that you feel is important.  </p> <p>Rely on your instincts.  </p> <p>If Cure Dolly says this means that, then you might want to take a note of it.  </p> <p>Your notes do not need to be detailed, and you don't need to show them to anyone.  </p> <p>Your notes are YOUR notes, make them your notes.  </p> <p>Q: Why should I even do notes!

It should scroll the page down to the downloads section. Click the first option.  </p> <p>Download the required deck here (grab the latest <code>.apkg</code> file)  </p> <p>When you first open Anki, the first thing you'll see is the \"interface language selector\". This just decides what language Anki will be displayed in. Any language is fine.  </p> <p>Go into Tools on the top bar, and click Preferences (Ctrl+P).  </p> <p>In this window, click on the Review tab and change the Learn ahead limit to <code>900</code>.  </p> <p>Now click Close.  </p> <p>In Anki, there are 3 buttons on the bottom of the window. The button Import File is how you'll be importing your downloaded deck.  Once clicked, it should open the file picker window.   </p> <p>Choose your downloaded deck.  </p> <p>When it finishes importing it should show you a box with bunch of text. Just press ok.  </p> <p>Now you'll see the deck and a blue number next to it.  </p> <p>The blue number is how many new cards you will be doing in a day.  </p> <p>20 cards is the default.  </p> <p>20 cards may or not be manageable.  </p> <p>You might want to lower the number of cards if you find it too hard to keep up with reviews. But don't worry about it right now.   </p> <p>Click the cog icon next to the Kaishi 1.5k deck.  </p> <p>Click Options.  </p> <p>Change Maximum reviews/day to <code>9999</code>. This just means \"uncapped\".  </p> <p>The default is 200 and I don't think your cards will pile up that high if you do Anki every day but,  </p> <p>It is good practice to uncap your review limit.  </p> <p>Just some Anki know-how.  </p> <p>You also need to change the Learning steps to <code>1m 5m 10m</code>.  </p> <p>Change Insertion order, to Sequential (oldest cards first) </p> <p>Under the Lapses section, change the Relearning Steps to <code>10m</code>.  </p> <p>Under the Display Order section, change the New/review order to Show before reviews.  </p> <p>Now click Save.  </p> <p>I also want you to install the Speed Focus Mode Anki add-on. I will explain why later, but let's just install it now.  </p> <p>Click on Tools at the top of Anki, and click Add-ons.  </p> <p>Click Get Add-ons....   </p> <p>Paste this code into the box: <code>1046608507</code> and click OK.</p> <p>You need to restart Anki. Close Anki, and launch it back up.  </p> <p>Click the cog icon next to the Kaishi 1.5k deck.  </p> <p>Hold the Shift key and click Options.  </p> <p>A different looking menu with some red text should open. (If it did not, you did it wrong. You need to hold Shift while clicking Options).  </p> <p>In the General tab, there are a few settings you need to change.  </p> <p>Change Automatically play alert to <code>15</code> seconds.  </p> <p>Change Automatically show answer to <code>30</code> seconds.  </p> <p>Change Automatically rate 'again' to <code>180</code> seconds.  </p> <p>Now let's get to studying the deck.  </p> <p>When you click on the name of the deck, you'll be able to start learning by clicking Study now </p> <p>First thing you'll see is an explanation card. Feel free to delete this one.</p> <p>The next card is a word that is using kanji.  </p> <p>If you click \"Show answer\", it reveals the back of the card, and you will be able to find out how to read the word on the front.  </p> <p>The deck has other features, such as word meaning, audio, sentence and translations.  </p> <p>BUT the only things you should be memorising is the word on the front, reading and word meaning.</p> <p>Do not waste your brain power on thinking about anything else.  </p> <p>Look at the bottom bar. There are 4 buttons. These are your grading options. </p> <p>In Anki, you have to manually grade yourself.   </p> <p>Think of Again as \"I GOT IT WRONG\". Easy as SUPER EASY, Good as normal/usual/eh, and Hard as \"I struggled with this it took me a while BUT I still got it right\".  </p> <p>Because this is a card that is seen for the first time, press \"Again\".  </p> <p>When seeing \"unseen cards\" (cards that you haven't graded yet.) it is common and best practice to reveal the back (by pressing Show answer), then read the important information (Reading and Meaning) and then pressing Again.  </p> <p>This will send the card to the \"Learning\" pile. </p> <p>You see the red number on the bottom bar turned from 0 to 1?  </p> <p>The red number is the learning pile.  </p> <p>Blue: New pile Red: Learning pile Green: Review pile  </p> <p>The learning pile means Anki will show you the card multiple times so you can remember it. </p> <p>Getting a \"Good\" enough times will cause the card to graduate. This means you'll see it in x number of days (Usually 1 day for new cards).  </p> <p>When the learning pile (red number) goes down that means the card has graduated.  </p> <p>Do not spend a long time looking at the same card </p> <p>When you don't know the word even after 15 seconds of looking at it, then looking at it for even longer doesn't mean you'll suddenly remember it.  </p> <p>So, the purpose of the Speed Focus Mode add-on is to stop you from spending too much time on one card.  </p> <p>My card learning method </p> <p>Step 1: Look at the card. Step 2: Recognize whether it is a new card or not. Step 3: Reveal the back (Show answer) after realizing it is a new card. Step 4: Read the reading. Step 5: Read the meaning. Step 6: Let the audio play. Step 7: For now, press \"Again\" Step 8: Above 7 steps will be the same if the next card is also a new card but... Step 9: If the next card is one I've already seen before, I test my knowledge. Step 10: I try to recall the word's meaning and the reading. Step 11: There are sometimes more than 1 meaning.

You can use Jisho.org with the #sentence tag to see example sentences with an English translation.  </p> <p>Setting up a Japanese Keyboard </p> <p>Now let's set up a Japanese keyboard. </p> <p>Read this article: http://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/centers/ilrc/technical-support/jpn-win-keyboard-entry/ </p> <p>The article is very good. </p> <p>After you've done that lemme teach you the most useful functions.</p> <p>Alt` (backquote)(the key left of 1): Switch from entering just letters like these to kana like this: \u304b\u306a. if you type \"kana\" when the symbol on the taskbar is an \"A\" it will just be \"kana\" but if the symbol is \u3042 then it will become \"\u304b\u306a\"</p> <p>Space: Conversion. When you want to type a kanji, you have to type its reading, and then use space to convert it. Due to Japanese's... japanesesiness, there are multiple conversion candidates for the kana you entered. Let's try a word you probably just learned, like \u8a00\u3046. To type that in kanji you have to switch to kana input mode (the \u3042 symbol) and type \u3044\u3046, then press space until \u8a00\u3046 is selected, and then press Enter. If you want to enter kana without converting, just type what you want and press enter.  </p> <p>F7: Katakana conversion. </p> <p>WinSpace: Switch input methods (only effective if you have more than one input method (example <code>English (UK)</code> and <code>Japanese (Japan)</code>)  </p> <p>Now I think it is about time you do your daily immersion.  </p> <p>I hope the dice game helped you get used to immersing.  </p> <p>I recommend you decide on a set number of anime episodes to use for immersion per day.  </p> <p>If you can't decide, then by all means, let a dice decide for you! </p> <p>Roll a 4-sided dice </p>"},{"location":"routine/#day-5","title":"Day 5","text":"<p>Go on this site https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html and practice kana for 10 minutes. https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/.  </p> <p>Now do your daily Anki.  </p> <p>Anki is tough in the beginning.  </p> <p>But it gets better I promise!  </p> <p>Your Anki today will be slightly different.

Love Live (2013) as an example.  </p> <p>The site Kitsunekko has the biggest collection of Japanese subtitles for anime.   </p> <p>(NOTE: The site has a tendency of going down randomly. You can view a backup here) </p> <p>I scrolled down to \"Love Live!\", and downloaded the \"Love Live! (01-13) (Webrip).zip\" file.  </p> <p>After unzipping the file, I got a bunch of .SRT files. </p> <p>.SRT files are subtitle files.  </p> <p>Now what you need to do is drag and drop an .SRT file onto a video.  </p> <p>The asbplayer extension works with Hianime. I recommend streaming from there.  </p> <p>Before you start playing an episode, make sure you have this page open: https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/ </p> <p>When an episode starts playing, you can drag and drop an .SRT file onto it.  </p> <p>The subtitles should load and work.  </p> <p>English subtitles display at the same time, which is bad for learning because English subs can confuse you when you try to understand the actual Japanese structure behind the meaning. For just giving context to the audio, they are fine though. Anyway, to disable English subtitles, click the CC icon on the video player controls and click Off.  </p> <p>By using Shift on a word, Yomichan should pop up with a dictionary definition. </p> <p>But there is a problem. The subtitle file for Love Live is horribly out of sync!  </p> <p>This means the subtitles don't match the timing of the audio.  </p> <p>Luckily, asbplayer supports adjusting the timing.  </p> <p>You can do that with CtrlShiftLeft or Right. Sometimes it doesn't work if you don't click on the video first. You will need to experiment to find the right timing. For Love Live it was -8400ms.  </p> <p>It might be hard to figure out what subtitle belongs to what audio when reading is so difficult. </p> <p>Sentences written in kana make it easier to tell which is which though.  </p> <p>This page https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/ displays the subtitles in a list. This makes it easier to go back to a line you missed. It only works if you had it open before loading the subtitle.  </p> <p>This also enables you to \"read\" the anime! Which I recommend you do!!! </p> <p>So, what's the routine?  </p> <p>Watch the anime with Japanese subtitles first.  </p> <p>Then focus your attention on just reading it.  </p> <p>Q: How many words do I look up? </p> <p>A: I think you should decide this using a 20-sided dice, per episode.  </p> <p>Click here for 20-sided dice </p> <p>Roll!  </p> <p>After you've looked up your amount just watch the rest with Japanese subs.  </p> <p>If anything piques your interest, then feel free to look it up!  </p> <p>Q: When watching with Japanese subs, do I try to read everything on the screen?</p> <p>A: No. I generally recommend looking up the number of words the dice decided and then just watch the rest of the episode without looking anything up or stopping to read anything, but you should focus on how the kana are pronounced etc.  </p> <p>Q: When I look up something, or need to read something, do I pause the video? </p> <p>A: Yes! Pause the video when you need to look up!  </p> <p>Q: What is the point of the subtitles in a list? </p> <p>A: You do it so you can do \"raw reading practice\".  </p> <p>When the anime playing, you are doing half-reading half-listening.  </p> <p>When you remove the audio part and just read the subtitles in a list, you are doing the equivalent of real reading!  </p> <p>Q: Does the dice decide how many words I look up while watching the anime or while reading the subtitles in a list? </p> <p>A: Roll another 20 sided dice for when you read the anime.  </p> <p>Q: How many episodes should I read? </p> <p>Focus on reading a single anime episode until you've looked up the amount of dice decided words.  </p> <p>Q: Is it possible to understand everything by spending 30 minutes spamming Yomichan on a sentence? </p> <p>A: Short answer: No. Comprehension is a gradual process.  </p> <p>Long answer:  </p> <p>There are many things you will not understand just by using a dictionary.  </p> <p>There are many factors that go into understanding something.  </p> <p>There are obvious factors such as vocabulary and grammar.</p> <p>But there are also less obvious ones such as the contexts that that piece of language is often used in, which in turns leads to its meaning.  </p> <p>In a vacuum, studying vocabulary and grammar increases your ability to understand things.  </p> <p>But understanding the use of the vocabulary and grammar in contexts further increases your understanding of the sentence.  </p> <p>This works especially well for sentences that have only one piece of language that you aren't comfortable with.  </p> <p>This doesn't work well for hard sentences though.  </p> <p>Because there is too much language information in the sentence that you are too unfamiliar with.  </p> <p>The best you can do for hard sentences is to look up the vocabulary in them.  </p> <p>While it may not be enough to understand that sentence at that time, your newly found knowledge of the word can help you connect it to some meaning in a later context.  </p> <p>With more study and immersion (understanding things in context), your understanding of Japanese will increase.  </p> <p>Q: Do I have to change the anime I'm reading to the one I last watched? </p> <p>No. I actually recommend reading the same one until you read the end.  </p> <p>But you don't have to always use the same one if it no longer interests you.  </p> <p>Q: How can I expect to remember the words I look up? </p> <p>A: Great question! It all comes down to repetition. The more reading you do, the more words you will remember.  </p> <p>In other words, don't fuss over the words you look up right now.  </p> <p>Looking over them a gajillion times isn't a productive use of your time.  </p> <p>What you should actually do is: Look at the meaning, look at the reading. Then go like \"Oh, right!\". And move on.  </p> <p>Q: How do I figure out where a word starts and ends? Japanese has no spaces! </p> <p>A: The simple answer is, it is hard to tell as a beginner.  </p> <p>You get better at it over time.  </p> <p>Language learning is just pattern recognition after all.  </p> <p>Yomichan is a great help because it knows where words start and end with 90% accuracy.  </p> <p>Q: Now that I can see the Japanese, can I try to translate it in my head? </p> <p>A: It's complicated...   </p> <p>There are always forms of expression that just aren't compatible between English and Japanese.  </p> <p>The way of thinking is a lot different.  </p> <p>That is the main reason why this method (and similar ones) tends to advise against trying to translate your immersion.  </p> <p>Because Japanese is not English.  </p> <p>You are advised to think of Japanese as Japanese.  </p> <p>Be the language!  </p> <p>You can do some sort of \"loose translation\", where you just try to piece together some sort of basic meaning.  </p> <p>Do I need to translate at all? </p> <p>Not always, it is inevitable that there are things you will just not understand due to many factors. (Missing knowledge of: word meaning, word meaning that's hard to understand just from the dictionary, grammar usage, advanced grammar usage, context, how the word is generally used in the wider scope of language etc.)  </p> <p>It is also tiring, so do it in moderation.  </p> <p>Q: How many episodes should I watch with Japanese subs until I go back to no subs? </p> <p>A: 1 Japanese subtitled episode per day is a good number. 2 or 3 if you want to go all out.  </p> <p>Q: Should I watch Japanese subs or raw? </p> <p>A: They exist for different purposes.  </p> <p>I can't say which one is better because they have their own benefits and drawbacks.  </p> <p>Japanese subs:  Good: learn new words, reading practice Bad: doesn't train raw listening ability, you might not pick up on things said in the audio  </p> <p>Raw: Good: trains raw listening ability and can attribute to speaking ability too. You will notice more than just watching with Japanese subtitles. Bad: the words you dont know you just don't know.  </p> <p>Q: What about subtitle tutor? </p> <p>A: You shouldn't be doing it all the time.  </p> <p>The only purpose is to give you an idea; context of what the audio is saying.  </p> <p>It gets tedious watching the same episode twice too.</p> <p>Without watching the episode in Japanese after you watch it in English, there is no point.  </p> <p>And using English subs as a crutch forever isn't a good idea.  </p> <p>It just makes your immersion more effective in the beginning because immersion works better when you have an idea of what is going on.  </p> <p>Getting rid of translations and training yourself to understand the language on its own is how you'll get better at Japanese in the future.  </p> <p>Japanese subs are better because they give you the opportunity to learn the actual words that are being used in the anime.

This article will just extensively detail my learning approach, specific things I did and overall philosophy to learning Japanese.  </p> <p>Everyone learns differently. Not because some people can leave out important ingredients (immersion. this is a non-negotiable btw), but because everyone each has their own way of doing what is supposedly the \"same\" method.  For better or for worse,  everyone has their own spin-off of what can be classified as \"the immersion method\".  </p> <p>Naturally, this individual variation means everyone is doing technically a different thing to learn Japanese, and that is something to take into consideration. My philosophy in life is that \"everything matters\". It would border on intellectual dishonesty to shrug off variation in learning approaches as \"insignificant\" to a final goal as monumental as getting proficient at Japanese. The process is too intertwined.  </p> <p>I believe the process has a lot of moving parts, and that everything is important. And because everything matters, I also believe that certain steps and methods to learning Japanese could also be the difference between making it and not making it.  </p> <p>Whether or not this is important to you is up for you to decide. Deciding if \"being good\"/\"making it\" is even a matter of concern for you is entirely dependent on your goals. You can never change someone's goals. I understand this painfully well, to the point \"it depends on your goals.\" has become a bit of a \u53e3\u7656 for me whenever I answer questions in the TheMoeWay Discord. Factually, there is never really a cut-and-dry answer in Japanese learning.  </p> <p>My goals though, have always been to:  </p> <ul> <li>get good at Japanese</li> <li>help others learn</li> </ul> <p>My primary motivation for writing TheMoeWay in the first place was because I felt like important information was being withheld from me. This was around 2018-2019. Immersion wasn't exactly considered mainstream in the community back then. The community did nothing but keep each other stuck in an eternal beginner loop, where the only people who were permitted to climb the ladder where those who lived in Japan and developed a social life around the Japanese language.  </p> <p>When I first found out about immersion through \"AJATT\" and Matt vs. Japan, it was near-revolutionary to me at the time. It gave me exactly what I wanted. The mindset, the pragmatic approach, etc., it was everything that I felt was critically lacking in the Japanese learning community. I was tired of the bullshit. I knew things had to change. I knew I had to spread this information to make sure others don't fall into same traps I fell into.  </p> <p>In a way, TheMoeWay was just me writing to my past self. It didn't matter if what I was writing wasn't entirely factual, the crucial part was that the information was everything my past-self wishes they could have known.  </p> <p>And with that, people shill my website without me even doing anything. I have never advertised my site myself. I wrote what I thought would help people and people started sharing it around. </p> <p>The fact that something I wrote as a teenager, without any expectation of it getting popular, ended up helping so many people still feels surreal to me. Combined with the continued encouragement from members of the TheMoeWay Discord to finally put \"the Shoui method\" into words, it feels like the right time to do so.  Even if this write-up is dismissed as too opinionated, too eccentric, or eventually fades into obscurity, helping even 1 person achieve their goals would be enough. I didn't just want to get good at Japanese, I always wanted to make the path clearer for others who were struggling in the same ways I once did.  </p> <p>If this can help even one person break out of stagnation, it would mean the world to me.  </p> <p>P.S., this is not a general guide for the average person interested in self-study, that would be Japanese Guide.

He was the only person in that community who wasn't a haafu, \u5e30\u56fd\u5b50\u5973 or Chinese or Japanese native that had good Japanese.   I held onto this, that's when I started looking into immersion methods. That's when I found the classic DJT guide. I will say though, this guide does a very bad job at telling you what the process of getting good actually looks like, and leaves out two crucial components: raw listening and tolerating ambiguity.  </p> <p>That guide told you to do Core2k (Kaishi didn't exist then). But I already knew too many of the words because I grinded N5 and N4, so I didn't do Core2k, and started reading. But it was too grueling.  Being told \"just read\" while not understanding key concepts such as acquisition vs. learning and tolerating ambiguity set me on the path for burnout. I didn't make much meaningful progress, because I spent hours on single pages, and thought I had to understand EVERYTHING from day 1 of immersion for it to be \"real learning.\" There was no way for me to rack up a huge amount of Japanese exposure with such an approach.  </p> <p>It was only when I discovered AJATT through Matt vs. Japan and was introduced to the concept of tolerating ambiguity that I finally started to make progress I could call progress.  The idea of \"if you want to get good at watching anime without subtitles, then start watching without subtitles now!\" was exactly right. After taking his advice and trying it out for myself, I was convinced. Because the words I learned now finally had application. And because, after a while, I could finally understand raw Japanese, no crutches, no Japanese subs, no translation, no cope. And that was huge.  </p> <p>That's why I pass these ideas down in the Japanese Guide:</p> <ul> <li>learn vocab</li> <li>learn grammar</li> <li>immerse ASAP. listen without subs. tolerate ambiguity.  </li> </ul> <p>Also, when I started immersing, I ran into many \"ohh, so that's how you say that idea\" moments.

The only way to get good at listening raw is to just do it.  I tell people to listen raw from the beginning as a mindset thing. The longer you avoid raw listening, the harder it becomes to make yourself listen without subs the more you put effort into comfortable learning activities (Anki, reading, JP subs).  I don't want to make people fall into the trap of continuing to read and using subs, overwhelmed with the constant notion that they're not \"ready yet\".  It's so common to see people, so terrified to start raw listening, who are complacent with their reading ability, how many words they know in Anki and how well they can read Japanese subs. These people are good enough. Their issue is not that they aren't \"ready yet\", it's that they're too afraid to try. Also what's very common when people start listening for the first time is, they try to pause at every line and get very demotivated and upset when they don't understand everything. The truth is, no one has understood everything on their first day. I sure as hell didn't. So here's something important to remember: don't pause. Don't do it, I know you're tempted to, but don't do it. Don't pause.

I did RTK after I finished 1 book in Japanese, after being utterly convinced I had to do it by the classic AJATT philosophy.  To be honest, RTK is one of the most painful memories I have of learning Japanese, I dont know if anything else comes close. Doing 100 new vocab cards a day? Reading a book start to finish in a day? Listening for 10 hours every day? Doesn't even come close to the painfulness of RTK.</p> <p>Isolated kanji study is the most debated part of Japanese learning.

I am not one to immediately recommend every single Japanese learner to do RTK, but when I look at other learners, I always feel vindicated that RTK was, in fact, not a waste of time. It is quite common to see people in the TMW Discord post about how they thought a certain common kanji looked like another common kanji the entire time they've been learning. I never had this issue after I did RTK, lol. Unique kanji will immediately look unique, no confusion. People that have not done isolated kanji study and follow the advice of \"just read\" still confuse kanji that look slightly similar, proving that just reading is not enough for kanji mastery. In my opinion, ignoring the composition of kanji in favor of only reading is cope.   </p> <p>But the important question is, do you care?

I find it difficult to separate them cleanly. So I'll just make it clear what I was doing until I felt like I had advanced to \"the next stage of learning\". My immersion was still mainly listening, watching anime, j-drama, YouTube and listening to \u58f0\u512a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa everyday, but truth be told, I was coping hard over reading. I still considered reading secondary to listening, (and to be honest, I still do in my philosophy), but I really wanted to reach my goal of being able to read LNs in Japanese. I just found it too difficult to read a book in Japanese.  You know, it was still really difficult to enjoy reading a book in Japanese, even after all that effort, because it was too difficult to understand what was actually going on, and that felt so excruciating and demotivating. So I coped, and stuck with listening. I finished about 8 books in total around this time, but I still sucked at reading. That's when I was introduced to visual novels, and started shilling them because they were far more engaging than books.  That's what prompted me to make the VN Guide and say \"VNs supercharged my reading\". Because they did, before I read through a VN, I was coping hard. After that my reading noticeably improved and I felt more confident to read more, and I came back to books with my newfound skill and confidence.  I keep saying \"I was coping\" because even though I avoided reading, I firmly believed that I was stagnating hard by continuing to do my listening-focused approach. I knew I needed to read more to improve.  </p> <p>I found VN's easier to read in large amounts mainly because instead of a wall of text, all it took was a mouse click to feel like I am progressing, it's weird how that's all it takes for me to want to read more.  </p> <p>If you feel like you are hard-coping right now about reading, here's what you should do now:</p> <ul> <li>Find a VN you want to read.  </li> <li>Set yourself a goal to read a minimum of <code>20,000\u6587\u5b57</code> per day.*  </li> <li>Read that VN everyday. </li> </ul> <p>Do this with the setup in the VN Guide.  </p> <p>*It should be noted that this moji count depends on your current reading ability.

Make sure I understand everything. Look up everything I have even a shadow of a doubt of whether I truly understand it or not. Mine everything. ONLY use monolingual dictionaries unless I have no choice. Look up every word I don't know in the dictionaries. Mine all those words too.  </li> </ul> <p>I was making huge gains at this point, to say the least.

I really felt like I was no longer \"coping\" about reading. I felt like I got my first taste of what it feels like to be \"good\" at Japanese. My vocab size increased by so much, I could feel my listening substantially improve, just because I knew more words and Japanese in general.  </p> <p>I also decided it was a good time to finally revisit grammar. I learned all JLPT grammar points from the NihongoKyoshi grammar deck &amp; the DoJG Deck, after realizing that not learning them in isolation made me whitenoise them in immersion. For basic grammar, I decided it was a good opportunity to look up all basic grammar particles in a monolingual dictionary, read their definitions and try to internalize them the best I could.  </p> <p>I also thought it was a good time to try and \"master\" listening content. I started to play my favourite anime in the background constantly, as semi-passive-active immersion. I did this with the goal of eventually memorizing the whole script. I emphasized repetition in this stage, where I felt like re-watching, re-listening and re-reading was surprisingly helpful. This is also a pretty important cornerstone of the shoui method: memorize the stuff you listen to. </p> <p>So to summarize:</p> <ul> <li>Go full monolingual</li> <li>Watch an anime adapted from a light novel</li> <li>Read the full light novel, with only monolingual dictionaries. Mine EVERY word.  </li> <li>Split your time into reading weeks &amp; listening weeks.  </li> <li>Grind JLPT grammar points. </li> <li>Read monolingual dictionary definitions for basic grammar.  </li> <li>Repeat my favourite anime constantly in the background until I memorized the script.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"shouimethod/#stage-3-specialization","title":"Stage 3 \u2014 specialization","text":"<p>Throughout the earlier stages, you would have always felt like reading improved your listening, and listening improved your reading, but this compliment starts to shrinken when you are already good at each area.

What I've defined here (Jmdict+kenkyuusha) is just the basic list that will be fine for people that are not going monolingual yet. This is supposed to be a safety net when you are too lazy to highlight text for <code>SelectionText</code>. Ideally you would highlight your chosen definition, then press the green button to add a card, but I understand, that is actually a lot of work. So <code>MainDefinition</code> is your safety net. Your next safety net/fallback is <code>Glossary</code>, which contains everything in the Yomitan pop up when you added the card. Lapis is intelligent and can fallback to the relevant field if one is blank. (E.g., if <code>SelectionText</code> is blank, it will fallback to <code>MainDefinition</code>. If <code>MainDefinition</code> is blank, it will fallback to <code>Glossary</code>).  </p> <p>Also, warning: the JMdict name contains the date the dict was built, if you downloaded it from my drive, it should be <code>{single-glossary-jmdict-legacy-2026-01-14}</code>, if you got it directly from the source, the date will be different, so adjust accordingly.  </p> <p>[2] In my method, I put both the sentence and the word on the front. But I rarely ever read the sentence, it was just there for visual context. Depending on who you are, (if youre the type to use that sentence as a crutch, then remove the <code>y</code> please.), you might find this useful or you might find it to be shooting yourself in the foot. Personally, I liked having it, as it was more reflective of real world use without being tiresome and too easy at the same time like sentence cards.   </p> <p>[3] I put this to {document-title} because I mainly mined from novels when reading from \u30c3\u30c4, so this would be adding the name of the book as embedded information in the card that you can access later.  </p> <p>Now, all you need to do to mine a card, is hover over a word, hold Shift to show Yomitan, then press the green button. Test it with this: \u30c6\u30b9\u30c8. Use the green button to add the card. Press the book icon to open the Anki browser to the card.  </p> <p>Ideally, you should highlight the definition you want on the back, before pressing the green button. This makes your cards look really clean. \u3000</p> <p>Try that out with this word: \u3053\u306e\u4e16 \u3000</p> <p>Use your mouse to highlight the first line of the \u7814\u7a76\u793e\u3000\u65b0\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178\u3000\u7b2c\uff15\u7248\u3000definition, then press the green button. Press the book icon, then \"Preview\" in Anki to see how the card looks. Compare it to the previous card you added. The one where you highlighted the definition you wanted looks cleaner. If you want to refer to the full information when reviewing, Lapis lets you see that by clicking on the left and right edges of the box the definition is shown in.  </p> <p>My mining philosophy is to mine everything. I don't worry about what I mine. I also make sure to put as minimal effort into my mining process as possible. This means the majority of my cards are made by just clicking the green button or highlighting then clicking the green button.  </p> <p>Also, if the word you are mining is a noun or a very descriptive adjective, then you should search the word on Google Images, copy an image and put that in the \"Picture\" field of your card. This is the most manual intervention you need to do for your cards. I genuinely think having a picture on the back of the card when it's a noun is a night-and-day difference, so it's worth the effort.  </p> <p>If your Google keeps defaulting to Chinese results, it's because your Google is not set to Japanese yet. You can fix this Chinese results issue by either:</p> <ul> <li>setting your Google language to Japanese</li> <li>appending \u3068\u306f to all kanji-only searches</li> <li>Using this Google JP Only tampermonkey script I made.

This encapsulates my 2022 learning philosophy pretty well. </p> <pre><code>Shoui method\nProcess:\nRead full LN mine the whole thing then binge anime season (or listen to anything comprehensible for around 6 hours)\n# Rule A, When reading, don\u2019t move on to the next paragraph until you think you understand it inside and out (Read analytically). What matters is your EFFORT. (Whitenoising is cringe)\n# Rule A.a, As a beginner or intermediate you will never truly understand something 100%. Re-read books you enjoyed a lot at a later date to prove this point further. \n# Rule A.b, again, no matter how hard you try to understand something you may just not understand it at your stage. Re-immerse in that content at a later date to prove this point. \n# Rule B, Not all listening content is equal. The best is conversation/SoL. Audiobooks are not better despite having literary vocabulary. Audiobooks are a cope.\n# Rule C, Grammar study is needed. Doing Cure Dolly/DoJG and Nihongokyoshi-net JLPT grammar in monolingual is recommended. If you do not do grammar study you may very often \"whitenoise\" grammar points you see in the wild because you won't even know it is a grammar point. Immersion only works through comprehensible input. Make it comprehensible. Do grammar study. Look up everything. \n# Rule D, LNs over VNs because they are easy to pick up and read and easy to re-read later.\n# Rule D.a, Japanese subtitles are cope after the beginner stage. Do not use them when watching anime or whatever. Look at Rule G for more info. \n# Rule E, Reading will never make you fluent. Natural output will not come from reading. It will only come from listening.\n# Rule E.a, Pitch accent may or may not require dedicated study of the pitch accent patterns. ymmv\n# Rule E.b, Listening rules over all. Listening is the actual language, reading is not. \n# Rule, E.c, Do mental shadowing, or mental larping, while listening. Pretend you are the person speaking while listening. This helps a lot with your output just clicking and your Japanese inner monologue. \n# Rule F, Look up everything. Make sure you have a good Yomichan setup of all the recommended dictionaries. But there is a problem that arises when looking things up because ideally you will only want to look up things you do not yet know. But are you sure you really know the things you are choosing not to look up? Could you be whitenoising over a grammar point or a set expression thats written in a differrent order for example? Relates to rule A.a. \n# Rule G, Anki must be minimal and have no frills attached to it. Your cards should be as barebones as they can be. And you should think less about what you can or cannot do with an Anki card. For example, do not waste time thinking if you should even add the card in the first place, because shoui method anki setup has 0.1 second card creation, you should just add everything you had to look up. Do not think what grade you should give your cards. Install PassFail so you can use a binary grading system that will make your life easier. \n# Rule G.a, preferrably, mine from books. Mining from anime ruins enjoyment for me personally. It makes more sense to mine from books anyway because you are Yomichanning it anyway and the instant Anki card will be high quality with little to no manual intervention. I used to have \"Anime cards\" however I do not see how they are more beneficial than my one-click cards from novels. \n# Rule H, Monolingual dictionaries. It is an absolute necessity you switch to a monolingual dictionary as soon as possible. More info can be found in the monolingual guide. I do not have to explain.\n# Rule H.a, after you get decent you might want to start going down dictionary rabbit holes. The aim of this isn't to learn the word you looked up in the book you are reading, rather it is to learn the common words that the dictionary uses to fill the holes you still have in your Japanese. \n# Rule I, do not glamourize \"hard\" reading content. That is the stupidest thing that has ever plagued the Japanese learning community. Traditionally, reading something like Muramasa earned you big dick points in Japanese learning communities but this is unreasonable and does not make you good at Japanese. What makes you good at Japanese is being good at every other skill involved with reading and listening. \"Hard\" reading content tends to use obscure words and kanji while being easy grammar-wise. Just read what you want. There is always something to learn in all content, so never read anything just because of its difficulty. This is not a dick measuring contest.\n</code></pre> <p>And I still agree with all of it, other than the part about \"hard\" content. I said that in the context of average learners being obsessed with difficulty. The truth is, there is always something to learn in every content, and being good at Japanese means being good at every single skill, not just being able to read uncommon words. When you're already \"dekiru\" at Japanese, and can read novels just fine, you can improve in the shortest span of time by pushing yourself and reading the hardest stuff.  </p>"},{"location":"speaking/","title":"Speaking Japanese","text":"<p>Input is the core of getting good at speaking a foreign language. Output is just the icing on the cake.</p> <p>When it comes to learning a foreign language, we usually think, \u201cOh if I speak it a lot, I will get good!\u201d. Unfortunately, this is in fact false. Immersion (input) is how you get good at Japanese. In other words, listening and reading native content in Japanese. Natural phrasing comes with thousands of hours of input (specifically listening!). But you still have a \u201cceiling\u201d you need to reach, you can do that with speaking practice. You need to input so that you already know what\u2019s correct before speaking, because you have heard it in your input, so you will know exactly what natural thing to say before you have a conversation. With more input, your output ceiling rises, meaning you have higher output capacity. So speaking as a total beginner is pointless, your output ceiling is extremely low, so no amount of speaking practice can help you improve speaking. With a couple hundred hours more of input, your output ceiling will rise. Then you can practice speaking to hit your ceiling. You may know when you\u2019ve hit your ceiling when you try to say something but don\u2019t know how to express it naturally so you resort to translating from English to Japanese in your head using the grammar structures you memorized. When this happens it is clear you need more input. In other words if you can't think of how to express your thoughts, you need more input. After you feel confident again, you can go back to outputting.</p> <p>Another reason why it is bad to output early is that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and a native speaker won\u2019t inform you.

This is because it is to ensure you get a good accent in the end. The reason why you should listen to Japanese first is to build a model of how Japanese sounds in your head, to get you used to how Japanese sounds, for example how Japanese \"ra ri ru re ro\" sounds are much different than the English sounds. If you read without this knowledge, you may end up speaking with a foreign accent. Foreign accents happen when you think a sound in the target language is the same as a similar sounding sound in your native because you haven't listened long enough. It is almost impossible to read a language without applying any phonetic component to it, so even if you read in your head, you may still get this problem. Of course, if you don't care about accent, and would be fine with a gaijin accent, then you don't really need to listen. If you don't listen at all but just learn how to read that's fine if you still want to watch anime with subtitles, and just want to play VNs or whatever. Methods of approaching Japanese are never one-size-fits-all. But, I think it will really hurt your ego if you can read chuuni visual novels but can't understand anime, and you may not be motivated to start mass listening late because it's like, \"Why would I listen, I don't understand it.
