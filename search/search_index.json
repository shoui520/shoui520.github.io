However, this is in fact, false. First, let's consider just exactly why this argument exists in the first place. Usually when people say this, they don't know why the argument exists anyway, in other words, most people saying this don't know what they're talking about. The argument comes from the fact that if you learn Japanese using anime, you will think, \"\u304a\u3044\u3001\u3066\u3081\u3047\u306a\u306b\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff01\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\" and \"\u3061\u3063\u3001\u30aa\u30e9\u3041\u4e00\u756a\u5f37\u3047\u3093\u3060\u305c\", \"\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\u4f55\u30d6\u30c4\u30d6\u30c4\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff1f\u6253\u3063\u6bba\u3059\u305e\uff01\" is natural. (Just imagine some very cringe and rude things if you cant read it haha) In actual fact, this is not true at all. It is important to remember that every anime is different, some speak more natural than others, some may sound more masculine than others, some may sound more feminine than others. For example, \"Kimi no Na wa.\" is more natural than \"Dragon Ball Z\". And \"Love Live!\" is more natural than \"Kill la Kill\". In anime such as \"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Ren'ai Zunousen\", each character speaks different. Some characters speak like an \"anime\", while others actually sound pretty natural. Second, please take time to think: \"What is \"real\" Japanese?\"</p>"},{"location":"animejp/#real-japanese","title":"\"Real\" Japanese","text":"<p>Anime is often argued to be not \"real\" Japanese. People arguing this only say this because it is different from the artificial, watered-down mess they learn in the textbooks. In fact, textbook Japanese is very unnatural, and can be argued that it is not \"real\" Japanese. There's many forms of Japanese. Just like how there are many forms of English. Do you speak in the same exact way as someone else you know? Probably not. But does this mean they are wrong and their English is not \"real\"? Absolutely not.  Each person is unique to their own idiolects, different places have their own dialects, and so on. There are billions of different kinds of Japanese, so much so that it is not possible to point to a single form of Japanese and say that that one is the \"real\" Japanese. Anime in fact, is actually sometimes pretty natural, when I have conversations with Japanese friends what they say is close to what I've heard in anime before. Meanwhile, I have yet to experience Japanese people speaking sentences from textbooks.

Japanese made by a NATIVE FOR NATIVES. Anime is scripted by natives. Movies are scripted by natives. J-Drama is scripted by natives. These content are made for Japanese people, and aren't necessarily intended for learning but surprisingly they are an incredibly powerful tool for learning. Textbooks, although they may be written by a native, they are made for foreigners. The Japanese gets watered down, artificial and filtered, for foreigners.

This is just people picking examples of anime that fit their argument, and completely disregarding the plethora of natural-talking anime that exist. Older anime sometimes have unusual, outdated slang, take for example, \"\u30c0\u30c1\" slang for a friend is pretty outdated by today and would sound funny if you said it to a Japanese person.  Anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e yakuwarigo (role language), where the use of language is changed to fit how the character is like. For example, the anime villain may say \u8cb4\u69d8 kisama, or \u3066\u3081\u3047 a lot of the time, but anyone with a brain would know they shouldn't talk like that guy, so you won't end up saying it to a Japanese person. Because anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e, you will get a broad sense of immersion which means you would know what sounds masculine, what sounds feminine, arrogant, polite, sarcastic etc. Which makes it a very valuable immersion resource.

Please note that the usages of these are not consistent. So I can\u2019t really say for sure. Hiragana is used for words not written in kanji (such as \u3053\u3068 which also has a kanji form \u4e8b), whatever sticks out at the end of a verb (e.g. \u5473\u308f\u3046, \u639b\u3051\u308b. \u602f\u3080), things like \u201c\u3060\u308d\u3046, \u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u201d, particles (such as \u3092\u3001\u306e\u3001\u306f\u3001\u306b\u3001\u304c\u3001\u3067 etc.), someone's name (like \u3086\u307f, this can also be in kanji too because like I said it\u2019s not consistent). Katakana is mainly used for foreign/imported words such as \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 (communication from English), \u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30b2\u30f3 (R\u00f6ntgen from German), \u30aa\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc\u30c8 (oblaat from Dutch). But katakana is used in \u64ec\u97f3\u8a9e (giongo, onomatopoeic word). There are a lot of these in Japanese. But not all giongo are written in katakana, things like \u3042\u3063\u3055\u308a are almost always in hiragana, things like \u30b4\u30ef\u30b4\u30ef are more likely to be in katakana. A change in nuance perhaps? Katakana can also be used for foreign names. Kanji is used when it is used. Yes. Kanji is used when it\u2019s used. I recommend you just learn the usages through immersion.

In language learning, the method behind your learning makes a huge difference in the kind of progress you make.</p> <p>As it turns out, reaching such goals is not possible with \"traditional\" methods of Japanese learning. Many students are led to failure for not including a crucial ingredient, immersion, into their study routines. Immersion refers to listening to or reading native content made for native speakers.

The problem is they aren't actually engaging with the real language\u2014but what do I mean by that?</p> <p>Let's take swimming as an example. You can't just stay in the baby pool with floaters and take your time to become a pro at the baby pool before attempting to swim in a real pool. This won\u2019t make you a good swimmer. You also can't expect to become a good swimmer just by learning the theory behind the techniques in isolation and practising them without actually swimming in a real pool.</p> <p>How about a more relatable example: competitive video games. You won\u2019t get better at the game just playing against the AI and grinding in training mode all day. You have to play the real game against other people even if you think you\u2019re going to lose by a landslide. This is \"playing the real game\", with no strings attached.  </p>    It's important to learn how to move on!  <p>A common trap students fall into in language learning is staying on beginner resources for too long.  </p> <p>They want to ensure they know every single detail of their basics and refuse to move on to the real language. They refuse to engage in anything they aren't already comfortable with, because they're too afraid of not understanding anything. They may feel like they aren't \u201cready\". Yet it\u2019s important to leave your beginner resources as soon as possible because, in reality, you will never be ready until you actually start engaging with the real language and get yourself used to it.  </p> <p>Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword in language learning. As a perfectionist myself, I've suffered more than I've gained wanting to make sure I've gotten every single detail down of trivial things that didn't really matter in the big picture.  </p> <p>Learning a language is like climbing a mountain.

How you learn how to read it is by looking it up in a dictionary, such as Jisho.org. The dictionary shows it is read as \u304d\u3087\u3046, and means today.

The two modes are as follows:  </p> <p>These are the \"A\" and \"\u3042\" icons respectively. There is an indicator on your taskbar to tell you what mode you are in. The Direct Input mode types letters directly as they are on your keyboard, just like an English keyboard. The Hiragana input mode will initiate the input method editor (IME) as you are typing characters, and attempt to interpret your input as Japanese. </p> <p>You can switch between these two by either:  </p> <ul> <li>Clicking the A or \u3042 icon in the taskbar.  </li> <li>Using the Alt` keyboard shortcut. (Note: ` is the key to the left of 1.)  </li> </ul> <p>Windows remembers what input mode you were in, per-app. It is not a system-wide setting.  The default mode is Direct Input (A icon), so you will most likely be using Alt` whenever you want to type in Japanese.  </p> An infamous IME quirk <p> Most modern applications will ignore the IME if a textbox is not in focus, but older Windows programs (such as Computer Management) and Java applications (such as Minecraft) can activate the IME in the \"\u3042\u201d mode, even if a textbox is not in focus. You will see the IME appear in the top-left corner of your screen, like shown in the picture above. You can try this out by opening Computer Management, enabling the \u3042 mode with Alt`, and start typing. For this reason, it is good practice to stay in the A mode, or WinSpace to the English keyboard if it gets in your way.  </p> <p>In the \u3042 mode, you can try typing some words now:  </p> <ul> <li>\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f (type: <code>konnnitiha</code> and press Enter to finish the edit)</li> <li>\u6848\u5185 (type: <code>annnai</code>, press Space to select the \u6848\u5185 conversion candidate, and press Enter to finish the edit)</li> <li>\u79c1\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059 (type: <code>watasihanihonngowobennkyousiteimasu</code>, use Tab to choose the autocompletion candidate,  use Space to choose different conversions, then press Enter to finish the edit)</li> <li>\u30b3\u30ec\u30cf\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca\u30cb\u30e5\u30a6\u30ea\u30e7\u30af\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30b9 (type: <code>korehakatakananyuuryokutesutodesu</code>, use F7 to convert the entire input to katakana, then press Enter) to finish the edit</li> <li>\u8a18\u53f7\u3082\u5165\u529b\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u2190\u2192 (type: <code>kigoumonyuuryokudekimasu</code> use Tab to autocomplete the conversion, and press Enter to finish this edit, then type <code>hidari</code> and then use Space find the left-arrow in the conversion candidates, press Enter to finish this edit, then type <code>migi</code> and use Space to find the right-arrow, then finally press Enter again to finish the edit.)</li> <li>\u304b\u304d\u304f\u3051\u3053abc (type: <code>kakikukeko</code>, then while holding Shift, type <code>abc</code>, then press Enter.

Finish by pressing Enter)</li> <li><code>\uff21\uff22\uff23</code> (Hold Shift, then type <code>abc</code>, then press Enter to finish the edit)</li> </ul> <p>What on earth is an \"edit\"? In short, the IME must \"edit\" the text you typed in, so it can be displayed in the correct form you intended. Text that is currently being \"edited\" by the IME will be underlined. Having too much text in your edit buffer can overcomplicate things, so it is generally good practice to \"finish\" or \"commit\" edits with Enter after you got the form you wanted. </p> <p>You may have noticed how I use <code>ti</code> for typing \u3061. This is the Kunrei-shiki standard of romanization. I do it this way because it is faster than typing <code>chi</code>. Kunrei-shiki is not a requirement for using the IME, you can also use Hepburn romaji in the IME and it will work fine, except for \u306f/\u308f (must always be <code>ha</code> and <code>wa</code> respectively). (Try typing: <code>chikurin</code>, <code>an'nai</code>, <code>on'na</code>)  </p> <p>You also may have noticed the weird big numbers and letters that you can type with the IME. These are known as full-width characters. As the name suggests, they are wide and are designed to accomodate the width of Japanese characters, which are wider than Latin characters. This allows for a cleaner look consistent with Japanese standards. You can see this clearly demonstrated here: <code>\u3042\u3044\u3046\u3048\u304a\uff21\uff22\uff23\uff24\uff25\uff26ABCDEF</code> Full width characters can be only be typed in the \u3042 mode, and you can type them holding Shift then typing before an edit, or press F9 during an edit.  </p> <p>Feel free to experiment with the IME yourself in Copilot or Notepad!  </p>  Microsoft IME Cheatsheet  <p>A basic cheatsheet for the Microsoft IME on a non-JIS keyboard is as follows:  </p> <p>Finish and commit edit: Enter Discard current edit: Esc Convert, or press again to select a different candidate: Space Autocomplete, or cycle through candidates: Tab Navigate candidates: Up and Down or number keys for quick selection Switch between hiragana and Direct Input: Alt` Convert to hiragana: F6 Convert to katakana: F7 Convert to half-width katakana: F8 Convert to full-width romaji: F9 Convert to romaji: F10 Redo conversion: Win/ Undo last edit: CtrlZ Change back to hiragana (not applicable if edits are committed): CtrlBackspace Search candidate with Bing: CtrlB Type Yen symbol: Type <code>\u3048\u3093</code> and find <code>\u00a5</code> in the conversion candidates. Type any symbol: Type Japanese reading and find it in the conversion candidates. E.g. <code>\u3089\u3080\u3060</code> can give you the greek symbol <code>\u03bb</code>, <code>\u307d\u3093\u3069</code> can give you the British pound symbol <code>\u00a3</code>. <code>\u307f\u304e</code> can give you <code>\u2192</code>. etc.  </p> <p>By default, the Japanese IME  will use the English US keyboard layout (ShiftNum 2 = <code>@</code>). The only other officially supported option is the JIS keyboard layout, which you can switch to by changing your hardware keyboard layout for the IME to Japanese keyboard (106/109 key) and restarting your PC. You should not do this if you don't own a physical JIS keyboard with \u7121\u5909\u63db keys and such.  </p>"},{"location":"join/","title":"Before you do that...","text":"<p>Have you read the site?

Furthermore, learning the meanings for kanji can be useful for words like \u9023\u7d9a, \"take along, continue\" the kanji mean serial, consecutive. Remembering this can be helpful if you have constant trouble recalling the meaning of a certain word. However, the effectiveness of remembering meanings can be disputed. It is argued that these keywords assigned to kanji fade away as you get better at Japanese, and if you are good at Japanese and never studied kanji meanings, you would know what \u9023 means anyway. If you learn \u8336 as a word, you'll know it's tea. So if you come across \u7d05\u8336 and \u62b9\u8336 you may be able to guess that they are also some kind of tea.  In addition to that, Japanese people would describe \u9023 as \"\u9023\u52dd\u306e\u9023\" or \"\u9023\u5c04\u306e\u9023\" etc; not the keyword you learned.

This problem can be overcome by individually learning how to write each word. You can do this by writing out sentences (don't write isolated words, write sentences, this helps with proportions). However, the utility value of this can be disputed. With today's technology, do you really need to learn how to write all those words? Probably not. You can just input it into your IME.

A monolingual dictionary is a dictionary that defines words of the language in that language. For example, the Oxford Dictionary is a monolingual English dictionary. The K\u014djien (\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1) is a monolingual Japanese dictionary. Sites such as Jisho.org use the Japanese-English bilingual dictionary known as \u201cJMdict (English)\u201d.

You may not think so, but I\u2019ve been using monolingual dictionaries for a long time now and I can confirm bilingual definitions (especially those from the JMdict) do not capture the true feel of the word. Here\u2019s an example: </p> <p>\u6094\u3057\u3044 [\u304f\u3084\u3057\u3044]  </p> <p>If you have been learning Japanese for a few months, you would know this word.

It\u2019s so vague to the point that it is literally wrong. Now let\u2019s look at the monolingual definition.</p> <p>Taken from the Hybrid Shinjirin (\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797)</p> <p>\u5931\u6557\u3084\u6065\u8fb1\u3092\u7d4c\u9a13\u3057\u3066\uff0c\u3042\u304d\u3089\u3081\u305f\u308a\u5fd8\u308c\u305f\u308a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3055\u307e\u3002</p> <p>My translation of the definition:</p> <p>Go through failure and dishonour and not being able to give up nor forget (about it).</p> <p>And this gets less accurate when you put it into English.</p> <p>Did you get that from \u201cvexing, annoying\u201d? No. Probably not.</p> <p>Not convinced? Let\u2019s go through another example.</p> <p>\u60aa\u3044 [\u308f\u308b\u3044]</p> <p>Let me ask you one thing. What do you think this word means? If you answered, \u201cbad\u201d. Then you\u2019re only half wrong. This word is not equal to the English word \u201cbad\u201d.</p> <p>You can\u2019t use \u60aa\u3044 to say that your skill at something is inferior/poor, like you can in English. You use a completely different word in Japanese, and that\u2019s \u4e0b\u624b [\u3078\u305f]. See? And this is only scratching the surface of this problem.</p> <p>The other reason why you should use monolingual definitions is because they help you think in Japanese. Like I said before, there is no language that can express Japanese as well as Japanese itself can. Dictionary definitions are a way of thinking about words. I\u2019m sure dictionary authors (who are native speakers) put thought into each of their definitions when they wrote their definition, so by reading the definition and memorising it, you will have something at least close to what a native speaker may think of the word. If you learn words using a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary (such as JMdict) then you will have a GAIJIN way of thinking about things, and not even close to what a native may think about the word. This will set you back in getting a true understanding of the word. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can still get a true understanding with immersion, it just takes a lot longer than if you learned those words monolingually.</p> <p>Monolingual dictionaries are very powerful, and you will only realise this once they become second nature to you.</p>"},{"location":"monolingual/#why-people-find-it-hard-to-go-monolingual","title":"Why people find it hard to go monolingual.","text":"<p>Two reasons:  </p> <ul> <li>They don\u2019t know the words.  </li> <li>Are not used to the written Japanese.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"monolingual/#monolingual-transition-myths","title":"Monolingual transition myths","text":"<ul> <li>A profound belief that \"dictionary vocabulary\" exist. </li> </ul> <p>The truth: \u201cDictionary vocabulary\u201d = words you don\u2019t know because you don\u2019t read enough.</p>"},{"location":"monolingual/#using-morphman-to-assist-the-monolingual-transition","title":"Using Morphman to assist the monolingual transition","text":"<p>No.</p> <p>Morphman is an Anki addon (?) which automatically decides what words to add to Anki for you.

If you want guidelines on what to mine, then just mine every single word after you have read/watched it. The idea here is, when you are looking up stuff, it is inevitable you are going to remember some things but forget others, so when you go back and read/watch it again, you mine all the words you failed to remember the first time.

You'll hear everyone say something along those lines when asked about their learning goals. However, many also fail to reach these goals even after years of study. Is the language just too hard? Are they just not studying hard enough?</p> <p>I believe it's actually not their fault, but rather the method's. In language learning, the method behind your learning makes a huge difference in the kind of progress you make.</p> <p>As it turns out, reaching such goals is not possible with \"traditional\" methods of Japanese learning. Many students are led to failure for not including a crucial ingredient, immersion, into their study routines. Immersion refers to listening to or reading native content made for native speakers. For example, anime is originally in Japanese without subtitles, so when consumed in this form, we call it immersion.   </p>"},{"location":"new-guide-preview/#12-problems-with-traditional-methods","title":"1.2 Problems with traditional methods","text":"<p>A Japanese learner following a \u201ctraditional\u201d study method would usually go through the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Learning the alphabet(s).</li> <li>Learning basic sentences such as greetings and self-introductions.</li> <li>Learning basic grammar structure and vocabulary.</li> <li>Coming up with sentences either by having conversations with a tutor or study partner, or by writing.</li> <li>Translating example sentences from their native language to their target language and vice versa.</li> <li>Looking up further material about grammar structures and vocabulary in textbooks or YouTube videos recommended by a tutor.</li> <li>Practising conversation using knowledge from their study.</li> <li>Accumulating more vocabulary and grammar structures, which becomes a measure of one\u2019s own progress</li> <li>And finally, in the endgame, moving to or visiting Japan in hopes of having opportunities to practise their skills.</li> </ul> <p>None of that is bad in itself, it is actually sufficient study, but it's not enough to get you to a high level of proficiency. The problem is they aren't actually engaging with the real language\u2014but what do I mean by that?</p> <p>Let's take swimming as an example. You can't just stay in the baby pool with floaters and take your time to become a pro at the baby pool before attempting to swim in a real pool. This won\u2019t make you a good swimmer. You also can't expect to become a good swimmer just by learning the theory behind the techniques in isolation and practising them without actually swimming in a real pool.</p> <p>How about a more relatable example: competitive video games. You won\u2019t get better at the game just playing against the AI and grinding in training mode all day. You have to play the real game against other people even if you think you\u2019re going to lose by a landslide. This is \"playing the real game\", with no strings attached.  </p>    It's important to learn how to move on!  <p>A common trap students fall into in language learning is staying on beginner resources for too long.  </p> <p>They want to ensure they know every single detail of their basics and refuse to move on to the real language. They refuse to engage in anything they aren't already comfortable with, because they're too afraid of not understanding anything. They may feel like they aren't \u201cready\". Yet it\u2019s important to leave your beginner resources as soon as possible because, in reality, you will never be ready until you actually start engaging with the real language and get yourself used to it.  </p> <p>Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword in language learning. As a perfectionist myself, I've suffered more than I've gained wanting to make sure I've gotten every single detail down of trivial things that didn't really matter in the big picture.  </p> <p>Learning a language is like climbing a mountain. You can try to climb that mountain without anything assisting your ascent, and though it will take lots of struggle, you will eventually make it if you persist. Traditional study is like building a rope so that it's easier to climb that mountain, but you can't climb the mountain just by making a rope! You eventually have to climb it, because no matter how much rope you decide to make climbing that mountain is still going to be difficult and time-consuming.</p>"},{"location":"new-guide-preview/#13-the-scale-of-language","title":"1.3 The scale of language","text":"<p>Language is\u2026 huge.

They are logographic and are much more complex and wider in variety than kana. There are around 2000 to 3000 of them used in Japanese, however, do not let this number demotivate you, because kanji are not to be studied and grinded like kana are.  </p> <p>Kana are phonetically consistent and few in number so they can be studied in isolation and mastered in a short amount of time, however, kanji are not. They aren't used in the same way either, and aren't exactly logical. What do I mean by that?</p> <p>Let's take this as an example. Because kana represents the sounds in Japanese, we can write whatever we want according to the sounds as long as a kana exists for it, this includes writing English words. </p> <p>Now imagine I wrote the English sentence \"I am learning Japanese\" but using kana, it would be:</p> <p>\"\u3042\u3044\u3000\u3042\u3080\u3000\u3089\u3042\u306b\u3093\u3050\u3000\u3058\u3083\u3071\u306b\u3044\u305a\"  </p> <p>Of course, this is ridiculous and there is no reason why you would ever want to do that, but the point being: you aren't exactly able to do this with kanji without it being completely unreadable and incomprehensible.

Chinese, and Japanese for whatever reason decided they are going to use kanji to piece together different words and their different meanings. That is why there are so many of them and why you shouldn't let them scare you as they are meant to be learned along with the words that use them. After all... no one is going to think to front-load all the words before they learn how to read! That's ridiculous.  </p>    Kanji aren't words, but they make up the building blocks.    <p>Japanese has extra steps when it comes to learning how to read; due to kanji you need to constantly refer to a dictionary to learn how to read anything at all. Take this for example, if I showed you the word, \u4eca\u65e5, chances are you wouldn't be able to read it, or know what it means. How you learn how to read it is by looking it up in a dictionary, such as Jisho.org. The dictionary shows it is read as \u304d\u3087\u3046, and means today. If we had to look this word up while reading something, we internalise this piece of information and move on.

So please, don't limit yourself to my suggestions.  </p> <p>Your task: </p> <p>I want you to try immersing for the first time with the \"subtitle tutor\" method.  </p> <p>The subtitle tutor method is where you watch an episode of an anime with English subtitles, then watch it again without subtitles. Then listen to it when doing other things (wireless earbuds makes this easier).  </p> <p>The flowchart process:</p> <ol> <li>Watch with English subtitles  </li> <li>Watch without any subtitles (also known as raw listening)  </li> <li>Are you done for today? (Yes=Put the episodes on in the background to listen while you do other things. | No= Go back to step 1.)</li> </ol> <p>Essentially, by watching the episode with subtitles first, you have increased the comprehensibility of your input.  </p> <p>While watching the episode raw, don't worry if you can't understand.  </p> <p>Try to focus on the sounds, the speaking patterns and anything in it that you can make meaning out of.  </p> <p>Becoming able to understand Japanese is a skill that takes a long time.  </p> <p>But it all begins with raw listening and trying to make that listening comprehensible.  </p> <p>The subtitle tutor method is only meant to provide context for the audio you are listening to.   </p> <p>I also recommend listening to the audio when doing other things.  </p> <p>By doing that you are essentially filling in the silence with Japanese, which means, even if for a few seconds, you may pay attention to what's being said.  </p> <p>Note: Listening while doing other things = passive immersion. Listening with undivided attention = active immersion.  </p> <p>Q: Why immersion before any grammar or vocabulary study? </p> <p>A: Some of you might have wondered why I want you to immerse without knowing any grammar or whatever. And that's because listening is the crux of learning a language. Native speakers are so good at their language because of their environment (the language being there wherever they go), and by replicating that environment you can expect to replicate the results. Listening a lot even if you don't understand makes it easier to learn new words in Japanese and get a deeper feel for the language.  </p> <p>Q: So, I've completed my first episode, what should I do now?</p> <p>A: You can consider your immersion done for the day but if you want to do more (which is great) then you can roll a dice to decide how many episodes you want to watch.  </p> <p>Roll a dice </p> <p>I didn't want to overwhelm you on your second day, so you'll start learning about grammar tomorrow.  </p>"},{"location":"routine/#day-3","title":"Day 3","text":""},{"location":"routine/#stage-just-starting-grammar","title":"Stage: Just starting grammar","text":"<p>Do your daily kana practice on this site! https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html for 10 minutes.  </p> <p>Use a timer here: https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/ </p> <p>Now here's where you'll start grammar.  </p> <p>You don't need to do any drills or anything.    </p> <p>You don't need to choose the correct patterns or anything like that.   </p> <p>Everything you will be learning is insanely common and will be reinforced with your daily immersion.     </p> <p>The grammar guide I want you to use is Cure Dolly's Organic Japanese.  </p> <p>The YouTube playlist is here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj </p> <p>For folks out there that prefer reading, here is the Cure Dolly fan-made textbook!  </p> <p>All I want you to do is watch the videos and take notes</p> <p>(Google Keep note taking site here: https://keep.google.com/)  </p> <p>Note: I recommend turning on the subtitles for Cure Dolly's videos. </p> <p>Watch 3 videos a day </p> <p>That is a good number, you will be near the end of her guide after 30 days at that pace.  </p> <p>Take notes. </p> <p>Q: What should I even put in my notes? </p> <p>A: You should put information that you feel is important.  </p> <p>Rely on your instincts.  </p> <p>If Cure Dolly says this means that, then you might want to take a note of it.  </p> <p>Your notes do not need to be detailed, and you don't need to show them to anyone.  </p> <p>Your notes are YOUR notes, make them your notes.  </p> <p>Q: Why should I even do notes!

It should scroll the page down to the downloads section. Click the first option.  </p> <p>Download the required deck here (grab the latest <code>.apkg</code> file)  </p> <p>When you first open Anki, the first thing you'll see is the \"interface language selector\". This just decides what language Anki will be displayed in. Any language is fine.  </p> <p>Go into Tools on the top bar, and click Preferences (Ctrl+P).  </p> <p>In this window, click on the Review tab and change the Learn ahead limit to <code>900</code>.  </p> <p>Now click Close.  </p> <p>In Anki, there are 3 buttons on the bottom of the window. The button Import File is how you'll be importing your downloaded deck.  Once clicked, it should open the file picker window.   </p> <p>Choose your downloaded deck.  </p> <p>When it finishes importing it should show you a box with bunch of text. Just press ok.  </p> <p>Now you'll see the deck and a blue number next to it.  </p> <p>The blue number is how many new cards you will be doing in a day.  </p> <p>20 cards is the default.  </p> <p>20 cards may or not be manageable.  </p> <p>You might want to lower the number of cards if you find it too hard to keep up with reviews. But don't worry about it right now.   </p> <p>Click the cog icon next to the Kaishi 1.5k deck.  </p> <p>Click Options.  </p> <p>Change Maximum reviews/day to <code>9999</code>. This just means \"uncapped\".  </p> <p>The default is 200 and I don't think your cards will pile up that high if you do Anki every day but,  </p> <p>It is good practice to uncap your review limit.  </p> <p>Just some Anki know-how.  </p> <p>You also need to change the Learning steps to <code>1m 5m 10m</code>.  </p> <p>Change Insertion order, to Sequential (oldest cards first) </p> <p>Under the Lapses section, change the Relearning Steps to <code>10m</code>.  </p> <p>Under the Display Order section, change the New/review order to Show before reviews.  </p> <p>Now click Save.  </p> <p>I also want you to install the Speed Focus Mode Anki add-on. I will explain why later, but let's just install it now.  </p> <p>Click on Tools at the top of Anki, and click Add-ons.  </p> <p>Click Get Add-ons....   </p> <p>Paste this code into the box: <code>1046608507</code> and click OK.</p> <p>You need to restart Anki. Close Anki, and launch it back up.  </p> <p>Click the cog icon next to the Kaishi 1.5k deck.  </p> <p>Hold the Shift key and click Options.  </p> <p>A different looking menu with some red text should open. (If it did not, you did it wrong. You need to hold Shift while clicking Options).  </p> <p>In the General tab, there are a few settings you need to change.  </p> <p>Change Automatically play alert to <code>15</code> seconds.  </p> <p>Change Automatically show answer to <code>30</code> seconds.  </p> <p>Change Automatically rate 'again' to <code>180</code> seconds.  </p> <p>Now let's get to studying the deck.  </p> <p>When you click on the name of the deck, you'll be able to start learning by clicking Study now </p> <p>First thing you'll see is an explanation card. Feel free to delete this one.</p> <p>The next card is a word that is using kanji.  </p> <p>If you click \"Show answer\", it reveals the back of the card, and you will be able to find out how to read the word on the front.  </p> <p>The deck has other features, such as word meaning, audio, sentence and translations.  </p> <p>BUT the only things you should be memorising is the word on the front, reading and word meaning.</p> <p>Do not waste your brain power on thinking about anything else.  </p> <p>Look at the bottom bar. There are 4 buttons. These are your grading options. </p> <p>In Anki, you have to manually grade yourself.   </p> <p>Think of Again as \"I GOT IT WRONG\". Easy as SUPER EASY, Good as normal/usual/eh, and Hard as \"I struggled with this it took me a while BUT I still got it right\".  </p> <p>Because this is a card that is seen for the first time, press \"Again\".  </p> <p>When seeing \"unseen cards\" (cards that you haven't graded yet.) it is common and best practice to reveal the back (by pressing Show answer), then read the important information (Reading and Meaning) and then pressing Again.  </p> <p>This will send the card to the \"Learning\" pile. </p> <p>You see the red number on the bottom bar turned from 0 to 1?  </p> <p>The red number is the learning pile.  </p> <p>Blue: New pile Red: Learning pile Green: Review pile  </p> <p>The learning pile means Anki will show you the card multiple times so you can remember it. </p> <p>Getting a \"Good\" enough times will cause the card to graduate. This means you'll see it in x number of days (Usually 1 day for new cards).  </p> <p>When the learning pile (red number) goes down that means the card has graduated.  </p> <p>Do not spend a long time looking at the same card </p> <p>When you don't know the word even after 15 seconds of looking at it, then looking at it for even longer doesn't mean you'll suddenly remember it.  </p> <p>So, the purpose of the Speed Focus Mode add-on is to stop you from spending too much time on one card.  </p> <p>My card learning method </p> <p>Step 1: Look at the card. Step 2: Recognize whether it is a new card or not. Step 3: Reveal the back (Show answer) after realizing it is a new card. Step 4: Read the reading. Step 5: Read the meaning. Step 6: Let the audio play. Step 7: For now, press \"Again\" Step 8: Above 7 steps will be the same if the next card is also a new card but... Step 9: If the next card is one I've already seen before, I test my knowledge. Step 10: I try to recall the word's meaning and the reading. Step 11: There are sometimes more than 1 meaning. Only 1 meaning is enough. Step 12: I reveal the back. Step 13: I grade myself depending on if the meaning and reading I thought it was, was correct. Step 14: I usually use the Good button if I got it correct. Again if it wasn't correct.  </p> <p>After you have successfully learned 20 cards, you can consider your Anki done for the day.  </p> <p>The next day you can expect to see some cards in the green (Review) pile. </p> <p>You will also have a fresh batch of 20 new cards!  </p> <p>Please make sure you do Anki every day!   </p> <p>Q: Should I worry if I forget a lot? </p> <p>A: No.  </p> <p>Anki is made for things you're likely to forget.  </p> <p>You are very likely to forget words of a language you just started learning.  </p> <p>I don't think it is strange if you forget more than half of what you learn when a day passes by.  </p> <p>You're likely to forget these words without Anki, so that's why you need to keep Anki'ing them so you can finally learn the word.  </p> <p>In other words, just keep doing Anki.  </p> <p>If this continues for a while then you might want to think back on your method of doing Anki.   </p> <p>Q: Leeches (Words not sticking) </p> <p>Leeches are when you keep forgetting the word no matter what.  </p> <p>Memory works by picking up on cues.  </p> <p>When words don't stick, it means there are multiple things in the wider scope of the word that makes it so your mind isn't picking on any cues. </p> <p>In easier terms, you need more, or different information than the information on the card.  </p> <p>For these leeches, I recommend looking at them in example sentences. You can use Jisho.org with the #sentence tag to see example sentences with an English translation.  </p> <p>Setting up a Japanese Keyboard </p> <p>Now let's set up a Japanese keyboard. </p> <p>Read this article: http://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/centers/ilrc/technical-support/jpn-win-keyboard-entry/ </p> <p>The article is very good. </p> <p>After you've done that lemme teach you the most useful functions.</p> <p>Alt` (backquote)(the key left of 1): Switch from entering just letters like these to kana like this: \u304b\u306a. if you type \"kana\" when the symbol on the taskbar is an \"A\" it will just be \"kana\" but if the symbol is \u3042 then it will become \"\u304b\u306a\"</p> <p>Space: Conversion. When you want to type a kanji, you have to type its reading, and then use space to convert it. Due to Japanese's... japanesesiness, there are multiple conversion candidates for the kana you entered. Let's try a word you probably just learned, like \u8a00\u3046. To type that in kanji you have to switch to kana input mode (the \u3042 symbol) and type \u3044\u3046, then press space until \u8a00\u3046 is selected, and then press Enter. If you want to enter kana without converting, just type what you want and press enter.  </p> <p>F7: Katakana conversion. </p> <p>WinSpace: Switch input methods (only effective if you have more than one input method (example <code>English (UK)</code> and <code>Japanese (Japan)</code>)  </p> <p>Now I think it is about time you do your daily immersion.  </p> <p>I hope the dice game helped you get used to immersing.  </p> <p>I recommend you decide on a set number of anime episodes to use for immersion per day.  </p> <p>If you can't decide, then by all means, let a dice decide for you! </p> <p>Roll a 4-sided dice </p>"},{"location":"routine/#day-5","title":"Day 5","text":"<p>Go on this site https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html and practice kana for 10 minutes. https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/.  </p> <p>Now do your daily Anki.  </p> <p>Anki is tough in the beginning.  </p> <p>But it gets better I promise!  </p> <p>Your Anki today will be slightly different.

Love Live (2013) as an example.  </p> <p>The site Kitsunekko has the biggest collection of Japanese subtitles for anime.   </p> <p>(NOTE: The site has a tendency of going down randomly. You can view a backup here) </p> <p>I scrolled down to \"Love Live!\", and downloaded the \"Love Live! (01-13) (Webrip).zip\" file.  </p> <p>After unzipping the file, I got a bunch of .SRT files. </p> <p>.SRT files are subtitle files.  </p> <p>Now what you need to do is drag and drop an .SRT file onto a video.  </p> <p>The asbplayer extension works with Hianime. I recommend streaming from there.  </p> <p>Before you start playing an episode, make sure you have this page open: https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/ </p> <p>When an episode starts playing, you can drag and drop an .SRT file onto it.  </p> <p>The subtitles should load and work.  </p> <p>English subtitles display at the same time, which is bad for learning because English subs can confuse you when you try to understand the actual Japanese structure behind the meaning. For just giving context to the audio, they are fine though. Anyway, to disable English subtitles, click the CC icon on the video player controls and click Off.  </p> <p>By using Shift on a word, Yomichan should pop up with a dictionary definition. </p> <p>But there is a problem. The subtitle file for Love Live is horribly out of sync!  </p> <p>This means the subtitles don't match the timing of the audio.  </p> <p>Luckily, asbplayer supports adjusting the timing.  </p> <p>You can do that with CtrlShiftLeft or Right. Sometimes it doesn't work if you don't click on the video first. You will need to experiment to find the right timing. For Love Live it was -8400ms.  </p> <p>It might be hard to figure out what subtitle belongs to what audio when reading is so difficult. </p> <p>Sentences written in kana make it easier to tell which is which though.  </p> <p>This page https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/ displays the subtitles in a list. This makes it easier to go back to a line you missed. It only works if you had it open before loading the subtitle.  </p> <p>This also enables you to \"read\" the anime! Which I recommend you do!!! </p> <p>So, what's the routine?  </p> <p>Watch the anime with Japanese subtitles first.  </p> <p>Then focus your attention on just reading it.  </p> <p>Q: How many words do I look up? </p> <p>A: I think you should decide this using a 20-sided dice, per episode.  </p> <p>Click here for 20-sided dice </p> <p>Roll!  </p> <p>After you've looked up your amount just watch the rest with Japanese subs.  </p> <p>If anything piques your interest, then feel free to look it up!  </p> <p>Q: When watching with Japanese subs, do I try to read everything on the screen?</p> <p>A: No. I generally recommend looking up the number of words the dice decided and then just watch the rest of the episode without looking anything up or stopping to read anything, but you should focus on how the kana are pronounced etc.  </p> <p>Q: When I look up something, or need to read something, do I pause the video? </p> <p>A: Yes! Pause the video when you need to look up!  </p> <p>Q: What is the point of the subtitles in a list? </p> <p>A: You do it so you can do \"raw reading practice\".  </p> <p>When the anime playing, you are doing half-reading half-listening.  </p> <p>When you remove the audio part and just read the subtitles in a list, you are doing the equivalent of real reading!  </p> <p>Q: Does the dice decide how many words I look up while watching the anime or while reading the subtitles in a list? </p> <p>A: Roll another 20 sided dice for when you read the anime.  </p> <p>Q: How many episodes should I read? </p> <p>Focus on reading a single anime episode until you've looked up the amount of dice decided words.  </p> <p>Q: Is it possible to understand everything by spending 30 minutes spamming Yomichan on a sentence? </p> <p>A: Short answer: No. Comprehension is a gradual process.  </p> <p>Long answer:  </p> <p>There are many things you will not understand just by using a dictionary.  </p> <p>There are many factors that go into understanding something.  </p> <p>There are obvious factors such as vocabulary and grammar.</p> <p>But there are also less obvious ones such as the contexts that that piece of language is often used in, which in turns leads to its meaning.  </p> <p>In a vacuum, studying vocabulary and grammar increases your ability to understand things.  </p> <p>But understanding the use of the vocabulary and grammar in contexts further increases your understanding of the sentence.  </p> <p>This works especially well for sentences that have only one piece of language that you aren't comfortable with.  </p> <p>This doesn't work well for hard sentences though.  </p> <p>Because there is too much language information in the sentence that you are too unfamiliar with.  </p> <p>The best you can do for hard sentences is to look up the vocabulary in them.  </p> <p>While it may not be enough to understand that sentence at that time, your newly found knowledge of the word can help you connect it to some meaning in a later context.  </p> <p>With more study and immersion (understanding things in context), your understanding of Japanese will increase.  </p> <p>Q: Do I have to change the anime I'm reading to the one I last watched? </p> <p>No. I actually recommend reading the same one until you read the end.  </p> <p>But you don't have to always use the same one if it no longer interests you.  </p> <p>Q: How can I expect to remember the words I look up? </p> <p>A: Great question! It all comes down to repetition. The more reading you do, the more words you will remember.  </p> <p>In other words, don't fuss over the words you look up right now.  </p> <p>Looking over them a gajillion times isn't a productive use of your time.  </p> <p>What you should actually do is: Look at the meaning, look at the reading. Then go like \"Oh, right!\". And move on.  </p> <p>Q: How do I figure out where a word starts and ends? Japanese has no spaces! </p> <p>A: The simple answer is, it is hard to tell as a beginner.  </p> <p>You get better at it over time.  </p> <p>Language learning is just pattern recognition after all.  </p> <p>Yomichan is a great help because it knows where words start and end with 90% accuracy.  </p> <p>Q: Now that I can see the Japanese, can I try to translate it in my head? </p> <p>A: It's complicated...   </p> <p>There are always forms of expression that just aren't compatible between English and Japanese.  </p> <p>The way of thinking is a lot different.  </p> <p>That is the main reason why this method (and similar ones) tends to advise against trying to translate your immersion.  </p> <p>Because Japanese is not English.  </p> <p>You are advised to think of Japanese as Japanese.  </p> <p>Be the language!  </p> <p>You can do some sort of \"loose translation\", where you just try to piece together some sort of basic meaning.  </p> <p>Do I need to translate at all? </p> <p>Not always, it is inevitable that there are things you will just not understand due to many factors. (Missing knowledge of: word meaning, word meaning that's hard to understand just from the dictionary, grammar usage, advanced grammar usage, context, how the word is generally used in the wider scope of language etc.)  </p> <p>It is also tiring, so do it in moderation.  </p> <p>Q: How many episodes should I watch with Japanese subs until I go back to no subs? </p> <p>A: 1 Japanese subtitled episode per day is a good number. 2 or 3 if you want to go all out.  </p> <p>Q: Should I watch Japanese subs or raw? </p> <p>A: They exist for different purposes.  </p> <p>I can't say which one is better because they have their own benefits and drawbacks.  </p> <p>Japanese subs:  Good: learn new words, reading practice Bad: doesn't train raw listening ability, you might not pick up on things said in the audio  </p> <p>Raw: Good: trains raw listening ability and can attribute to speaking ability too.

Unfortunately, this is in fact false. Immersion (input) is how you get good at Japanese. In other words, listening and reading native content in Japanese. Natural phrasing comes with thousands of hours of input (specifically listening!). But you still have a \u201cceiling\u201d you need to reach, you can do that with speaking practice.

With more input, your output ceiling rises, meaning you have higher output capacity. So speaking as a total beginner is pointless, your output ceiling is extremely low, so no amount of speaking practice can help you improve speaking. With a couple hundred hours more of input, your output ceiling will rise. Then you can practice speaking to hit your ceiling. You may know when you\u2019ve hit your ceiling when you try to say something but don\u2019t know how to express it naturally so you resort to translating from English to Japanese in your head using the grammar structures you memorized.

This is because it is to ensure you get a good accent in the end. The reason why you should listen to Japanese first is to build a model of how Japanese sounds in your head, to get you used to how Japanese sounds, for example how Japanese \"ra ri ru re ro\" sounds are much different than the English sounds. If you read without this knowledge, you may end up speaking with a foreign accent. Foreign accents happen when you think a sound in the target language is the same as a similar sounding sound in your native because you haven't listened long enough. It is almost impossible to read a language without applying any phonetic component to it, so even if you read in your head, you may still get this problem. Of course, if you don't care about accent, and would be fine with a gaijin accent, then you don't really need to listen. If you don't listen at all but just learn how to read that's fine if you still want to watch anime with subtitles, and just want to play VNs or whatever.

Therefore, I believe that something stronger than the Snapdragon 732g will be able to run most VNs on this emulator.</p> <p>All the information on how to set up the emulator can be found here and here.

It was a paid project whose focus was essentially to run 32-bit Windows programs on Android. As I've mentioned before, even though I referred to them as \"Windows emulators\", the truth is that they are nothing more than Wine emulators.</p> <p>Having said that, let me rank ExaGear among the other three: it's the slowest and has the least support. As I mentioned before, it only works with 32-bit programs, so any 64-bit visual novel won't work on it. Furthermore, running it decently will depend a lot on the VN itself. I also recommend having a decent phone, but compared to Yuzu and Vita3K, anything with performance comparable to the Snapdragon 845 should be more than enough for this emulator. Oh, and even with a VERY good device, your VN may still lag a bit, or even take 10 minutes to open.
