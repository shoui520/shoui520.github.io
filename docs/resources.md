## Learning

### Kana  

- [**※ - Tae Kim - The Writing System**](https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/taekim.html#6%20The%20Scripts) - This page has an explanation of what the kana are and what they are used for. You may find this useful if you don't already know.
- [DJT Kana](https://djtguide.neocities.org/kana/index.html) - A simple kana recognition game. You may want to enable all the hiragana, and katakana and the combinations in order to properly test your skills. It also features a "play sound" button, which I recommend you make use of. 

### Kanji

**Important Note:** [Reading a lot](/readingtips) is the best way to learn kanji. This means you should learn kanji through learning to read words. We have linked Kaishi 1.5k as a deck to "learn kanji" this way. However, you can seek alternatives below if you keep forgetting how to read words you come across, or if you want to learn how to write.  

- [Kaishi 1.5k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1196762551) - The basic vocabulary deck the guide suggests to learn Japanese. You can also find it [here](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases) (click on the `.apkg` file).

- [Recognition Remembering The Kanji with less than 450 cards (RRTK)](https://mega.nz/file/2SJiWC4b#hL98qtC_hiLlQDg0LqVJoqD2-5ywT2Nwd4kjROY_KwQ) - Shortened version of RTK.   

### Vocabulary
- **[※ Kaishi 1.5k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1196762551)** - The basic vocabulary deck the guide suggests to learn Japanese. You can also find it [here](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases) (click on the `.apkg` file).  

#### Legacy vocab decks:
These are not recommended anymore.  

- [TheMoeWay Tango N5 Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pMlJvSrKQOSaiN8sPLdNDvWP31EClxDO/view?usp=sharing) - An older deck that was recommended before Kaishi 1.5k was made.  
- [TheMoeWay Tango N4 Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WX9AAKJgiTKN-SySPzuGG8T4nXVhWaSi/view?usp=sharing) - The follow-up deck to Tango N5 above, now superseded by Kaishi 1.5k.
- [Core2.3K VN Order Deck](https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/docs/coredeck/) - The optimized Core deck but ordered in terms of visual novel frequency. Got absorbed into Kaishi 1.5k.

### Grammar
- **[※ Yokubi](https://yoku.bi/)** - Effectively a condensed version of Tae Kim's grammar guide designed to get you understanding grammar as briefly as possible. Recommended for beginners.
- [Tae Kim’s Guide to Japanese, a guide for grammar](https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/taekim.html)
- **[※ Japanese Ammo by Misa Grammar Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5-Wp_4tLqYZxS5j3g6kbeOfVXlTkr3N)** - sleeper way of binging grammar.

- ["Making Sense of Japanese - What The Textbooks Don't Tell You" by Jay Rubin](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cl80gJyGbzdv4lGdcJhMJ1pGK_EZhCZv/view?usp=sharing) - similar to Cure Dolly, it's like the equivalent of the first few videos. It dispells common misconceptions about Japanese grammar people have due to studying Japanese grammar the "traditional" way.
- [NihongoKyoshi JLPT grammar](https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/) - JLPT "grammar" taught in Japanese. I recommend most people learn these *after* Cure Dolly/Tae Kim/yokubi/whatever guide you used. You should learn these because many of the grammar points can be easily overlooked when seen in the wild if you don't already know them.
- **[※ - NihongoKyoshi Anki Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tDBaabwgZMO8nxkcwcw4qBXayuk_513T/view?usp=sharing)** -  Highly recommended. It only has Japanese definitions, an intentional choice in order to avoid false associations of Japanese grammar with English words.   
- [Dictionary of Japanese Grammar - DoJG Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1013111837)  
- [JLAB anki course](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2110939339) - An anki deck that teaches kana, kanji and all the grammar from Tae Kim's guide.
