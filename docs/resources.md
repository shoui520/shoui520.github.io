- [Tae Kim - The Writing System](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/writing) - An explanation of the kana and a chart.  
- [DJT Kana, enable all kana in show/hide](https://djtguide.neocities.org/kana/index.html) - Test your kana skills!

- [Remembering the Kana](https://mega.nz/folder/Wk8VjJ6K#icqt2OiW4Vhle7q4cGUf_Q) - Remembering the Kana by James Heisig, only use when you are struggling immensely.  

### Kanji
*Note: Reading a lot is the best way to learn kanji. You can seek alternatives below if you keep forgetting how to read words you come across. Or if you want to learn how to write.*  

- [Remembering The Kanji (RTK)](https://mega.nz/folder/SkUABA5Q#4DT43HxP5vZi1pVq44_TVQ)  
- [(Uses RTK) Learn the Kanji](https://www.learnkanji.guide/) - Guide on how to use RTK.  
- [Recognition Remembering The Kanji with less than 450 cards (RRTK)](https://mega.nz/file/2SJiWC4b#hL98qtC_hiLlQDg0LqVJoqD2-5ywT2Nwd4kjROY_KwQ) - Shortened version of RTK.   
- [Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Course (KKLC)](https://mega.nz/#!ncYFXTyJ!KXwmhJu4QogtPasf0wt_zxyGvIfnm4gXxKsmdIv51sQ)

- [KanjiDamage](http://www.kanjidamage.com/) - Learn kanji composition with yo mama jokes. 

### Vocabulary
- [TheMoeWay Tango N5 Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pMlJvSrKQOSaiN8sPLdNDvWP31EClxDO/view?usp=sharing) - The first starter Anki deck you should use when starting out.  
- [TheMoeWay Tango N4 Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WX9AAKJgiTKN-SySPzuGG8T4nXVhWaSi/view?usp=sharing) - The second starter Anki deck you use after N5.  

!!! info "Tango Decks"
	It is recommended you do Tango over Core solely because Tango is easier.      
	You should get on to making your own mining deck after you finish N4.   
  
- [Core2.3K VN Order Deck](https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/docs/coredeck/) - the Core deck but ordered in terms of visual novel frequency.  

### Grammar
- [Cure Dolly’s Organic Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj) - explains Japanese in the best way possible. What she says is basically how Japanese grammar is thought of in Japanese, and then explained in English. As opposed to "traditional" way of Japanese grammar study, which distorts Japanese grammar to make it "easier" for Europeans.  
- [Cure Dolly Complete Transcript by dinuz](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpuXerkGU8waJ4DPDNJA4bGeqOvM-csXjTe57iHARHc) - Because the audio quality is awful, and the image is unpleasant but the information is very valuable.  
- [Tae Kim’s Guide to Japanese, a guide for grammar](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/grammar/taekim.html) - The one grammar guide everyone recommends.  
- [Dictionary of Grammar (DoJG) Reference](https://core6000.neocities.org/dojg/) - Table of all the grammar points in DoJG, helpful when you need quickly refer to a grammar point.  
- ["Making Sense of Japanese - What The Textbooks Don't Tell You" by Jay Rubin](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778430038159655012/908722684257501194/Jay_Rubin_-_Making_Sense_of_Japanese__What_the_Textbooks_Dont_Tell_You-Kodansha_USA_2021.epub) - similar to Cure Dolly, it's like the equivalent of the first few videos. It dispells common misconceptions about Japanese grammar people have due to studying Japanese grammar the traditional way.
- [Nihongo NET JLPT grammar](https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/) - JLPT grammar taught in Japanese. I recommend most people learn these *after* Cure Dolly/Tae Kim. You should learn these because many of the grammar points can be easily overlooked when seen in the wild if you don't already know them.

### Private Trackers
*Info: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker#Private_trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker#Private_trackers)*  
You can find hard to find things on private trackers. You can only get in by knowing someone that is already a member of these private trackers.

- **AvistaZ**, for Japanese drama and movies (I have **0** invites)   
- **AnimeBytes**, for anime, manga, VNs and such (I will not invite you.)  
- **Jpopsuki**, for Japanese music (I have **0** invites)  
- **jptv.club**, for Japanese TV with full Japanese subtitles. (I have **0** invites)  

### Other Software
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)- Archiver/Compresor. Better than WinRAR. 
- [WinCDEmu](https://wincdemu.sysprogs.org/) - Mount ISO/MDF/MDS files as a virtual drive on your computer
- [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) - 7-Zip alternative
- [DAEMON Tools](https://www.daemon-tools.cc/)- WinCDEmu alternative. Fares better with UDF volumes. 

### VPNs (Japan location specific)  

#### Free
- [(Cross-platform) VPN Gate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/) - free Japanese VPN servers with OpenVPN support.  
- [(Windows) SoftEther](https://www.softether.org/5-download) - Make sure you read the manual of this. 
- [(Android) VPN Japan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vpn.japan) - I wouldn't trust my privacy with this, but it works well to get a Japanese IP I guess.  
- [(iOS) Neko VPN](https://learnjapanese.link/vpnneko) - Seems to work fine. 

#### Paid
I only recommend Private Internet Access.  

- [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) - Not sponsored, I just trust this the most.   

#### Premium Cracks/Cheats/Accounts  

I usually find working premium VPN cheats/cracks over at [TeamOS](https://teamos-hkrg.com/forums/web-tools.74)

- [VPN Accounts Dump](https://leak.sx/dispenser_vpn.php) - Dump of VPN accounts. Kind of fishy though.  

You can search for “ExpressVPN crack apk” if you’re an Android user. Works sometimes.
