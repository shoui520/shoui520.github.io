![Chinese vs Japanese font](img/font1.png)

By default, your computer / phone will display kanji in a Chinese font. Japanese kanji look slightly different, and it can be damaging if you learn the Chinese appearance of kanji rather than the Japanese ones.  

**Verifying if your browser is currently using a Japanese font**

The one character that looks strikingly different between Japanese and Chinese fonts is [直](https://jisho.org/search/%E7%9B%B4%20%23kanji) which is used in the word [直す](https://jpdb.io/search?q=%E7%9B%B4%E3%81%99) (*naosu*) which means *cure, heal, fix*.

If your 直 looks like the second image, congrats! You are using a Japanese font, if not, change your font.  

## Windows 10

++win+i++ to open **Settings** > **Apps** > **Optional features** > **Add a feature** > Search **"Japanese supplemental fonts"** and **Install**  

??? tip "Advanced Users: Powershell"
	Japanese fonts can also be installed using **Windows Powershell (Administrator)**:
	```powershell
	Get-WindowsCapability -Online -Name Language.Fonts.Jpan~~~und-JPAN* | Add-WindowsCapability -Online
	```  
	This does not require a restart.
??? question "Also have Chinese supplemental fonts already installed?"
	You will need to set your locale to Japanese (Japan).
	!!! abstract "Setting Japanese locale"
		1. Open the Run dialog box by pressing ++windows+r++
		2. Type `intl.cpl` and press ++enter++
		3. Click on the *Administrative* tab, go to *Change system locale...* and select **Japanese (Japan)** and click OK.
		
Now if you're using a Chromium based browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Brave), click the Menu :material-dots-vertical: > **Settings** > click on **Appearance** on the left > **Customize fonts**. Here's where you'll need to set your fonts.  

Standard font: Meiryo UI  
Serif font: Yu Mincho  
Sans-serif font: Meiryo	  
Monospace: MS Gothic   

If you're using Firefox it is already pre-configured. 

## macOS

You just need to add Japanese as a preferred language in System Preferences.  
 > System Preferences, then click Language & Region. Click General, then Add a language and choose Japanese 日本語  

## Linux

You should have `ja_JP.UTF-8` as one of your locales. If not, uncomment the line `#ja_JP.UTF-8 UTF-8` in `/etc/locale.gen` and run:

```bash
sudo locale-gen
```

Now install the [noto-fonts-cjk](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/noto-fonts-cjk/) package. It is available on the official Arch repositories and it's known to set up the necessary fontconfig rules when installed in Arch.  

If _**any**_ part of that does not apply to you (p.e. different distro, different font, different method of installation), fontconfig may or may not have been set up properly.  
If you don't know how to check that, simply create a new file with the necessary fontconfig rules in the `~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d` directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist) for Japanese text. You can use [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Font_configuration/Examples#Japanese) section of the Arch Wiki or [this](https://github.com/tatsumoto-ren/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/99-japanese-fonts.conf) excellent example config file by tatsumoto-ren as references.  

#### Caveats

#### Browsers

##### Chromium-based

Chinese fonts can still persist even with the right setup in place (no idea why), so you may need to force it by doing the following:
 
:material-dots-vertical: > **Settings** > click on **Appearance** on the left > **Customize fonts**

Standard font: Noto Sans CJK JP Regular  
Serif font: Noto Serif CJK JP Regular  
Sans-serif font: Noto Sans CJK JP Regular  

##### Firefox

Unless Firefox has Japanese set as one of its languages or the webpage (or one of its sections) explicitly claims to be in Japanese (`lang="ja"`), it tends to fallback to Chinese characters. This is because Chinese fonts tend to have a more complete character coverage.  
To counteract this, do the following:

1. Open a new tab to `about:config`
2. Click through the warning page (if it appears)
3. Search for `font.cjk_pref_fallback_order`
4. Move `ja` to the front of the entire value

!!! warning "The commas are important"  
	They are there to separate the language values in that sentence, take care not to carelessly remove one.

## Android

Just add Japanese (it looks like this: 日本語) as a secondary language, it won't change your display language unless you move it to the top.  

![Android settings](img/font9.jpg)

## iOS

Adding the Japanese keyboard (kana or romaji whatever works) should do the trick.  

## Anki

I think Chinese fonts on Anki cards looks the worst because kana will be sans-serif and kanji will be serif AND out of proportion AND Chinese so it looks all out of place.

After you have installed Japanese fonts on your system it *should* automatically use Japanese fonts. If not, you will need to force it.  

### Forcing Japanese font in Anki   

IPAex Gothic is a good sans-serif Japanese font I recommend for Anki. You can download it [here](https://moji.or.jp/wp-content/ipafont/IPAexfont/ipaexg00401.zip)  

Install the font onto your system and reboot.  

Windows: Double click and click Install  
macOS: Drag the font into the Font Book  
Linux: Move the file to `~/.local/share/fonts/` and then run `fc-cache -f -v`  

Now in Anki click "Add" then click on "Cards" and then "Styling" and modify your font family accordingly.  

```css
.card {
 font-family: IPAexGothic; /* here is where you set font */
}
```

You can also change the font by putting the font into the Anki collection.media directory.  

Windows: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\(profile)\collection.media`  
macOS: ` ~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/(profile)/collection.media`  
Linux: `~/.local/share/Anki2/(profile)/collection.media`  
Android: `/storage/emulated/0/AnkiDroid/collection.media`  

Now in Anki click "Add" then click on "Cards" and then "Styling" and modify your font family accordingly.  

!!! warning "Don't copy exactly!"
	Just add what you don't already have. 

```css
.card {
 font-family: CustomFont; /* here is where you set font */

 @font-face { 
 	font-family: CustomFont; src: url('ipaexg.ttf'); } /* here is where you define the font */

}  
```

</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/img/font6.png" width="900" />
  <figcaption>With a bilingual definition.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now also change your font for the Anki *editor*. Click on "Add" then "Fields" and change the Editing font of each field to any one of these (or any other font you know is a Japanese font)

IPAexGothic  
Meiryo  
MS Gothic  
Yu Gothic  
Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro  
Noto Sans CJK JP Regular  

## Yomitan 

Yomitan's font should change according to your browser's font, but you can force Japanese font if not.   

Using Popup CSS...

```css
.kanji-link {
   font-family: IPAexGothic;
}

.source-text {
   font-family: IPAexGothic;
}

.gloss-content {
   font-family: IPAexGothic;
}

.tag-label-content {
   font-family: IPAexGothic;
}
```
