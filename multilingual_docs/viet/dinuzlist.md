This is my personal list of "easy" VNs. These are my opinions so you may not have the same experience, especially if you haven't read much before. If that's the case, your first VN is going to be insanely hard. You just have push through, and then you'll be able to comfortably read most other VNs (though you'll probably need to use a texthooker a fair bit)

Cool moege section (Probably do like one of these first, ideally, but if they REALLY aren't you thing, skip ahead)

[Kanon](https://vndb.org/v33) tương đối dễ

[Konosora/If my Heart had Wings](https://vndb.org/v9093) cũng tương đối dễ

[Charabration](https://vndb.org/v23242) tương đối dễ

[Flyable Heart](https://vndb.org/v1179) và [Nanatsuiro Drops](https://vndb.org/v193) cũng dễ nữa

Game theo cốt truyện:

[Aiyoku no Eustia](https://vndb.org/v3770) is engaging from the start and hard only in terms of vocabulary. Not terribly hard at all.

[Baldr Sky](https://vndb.org/v1306) tương đối dễ. Chuẩn bị đón nhận hàng tá Katakana.

[Chaos Head Noah](https://vndb.org/v22505) (make sure to get SD version) also isn't too bad.

[Original Tsukihime](https://vndb.org/v7) is weirdly easy for a supposed chuunige.

[Utawarerumono](https://vndb.org/v3) also doesn't seem too bad.

Harder games that are still reasonable (Don't do before at least two games from the previous two categories)

[Fate Stay](https://vndb.org/v11): Đôi lúc có từ vựng hơi "chuuni". Not insanely hard or anything though, just occasionally chuuni

[White Album 2](https://vndb.org/v7771): Strangely large vocab for what it is, pretty prose

[Subarashiki Hibi](https://vndb.org/v3144): Khó hiểu

[Saya no Uta](https://vndb.org/v97): Khó hơn mọi thứ ở đây, nhưng nó ngắn.

[Tsuriotsu](https://vndb.org/v10680): If you want to read [Oretsuba](https://vndb.org/v1141) at some point, this is probably the thing to play. Big line length, slang, language misunderstandings, but incredibly easy vocabulary. The prologue is written by the Oretsuba writer, so brace yourself for the first hour or two, after which its much easier
