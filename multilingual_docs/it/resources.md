# TheMoeWay Resources Sheet

Welcome to TheMoeWay Resources Sheet, resources are categorised into "Learning Japanese" and "Acquiring" Japanese".  

## Learning Japanese 

### Kana  

- [**※ - Tae Kim - The Writing System**](https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/taekim.html#6%20The%20Scripts) - This page has an explanation of what the kana are and what they are used for. You may find this useful if you don't already know.
- [DJT Kana](https://djtguide.neocities.org/kana/index.html) - A simple kana recognition game. You may want to enable all the hiragana, and katakana and the combinations in order to properly test your skills. It also features a "play sound" button, which I recommend you make use of. 

### Kanji

**Important Note:** [Reading a lot](/readingtips) is the best way to learn kanji. This means you should learn kanji through learning to read words. However, you can seek alternatives below if you keep forgetting how to read words you come across, or if you want to learn how to write.*  


- **[※ - The "Kanken Deck"](https://mega.nz/file/VVdkUZbI#lGvxw2hDkw7JCEWa90cViY7cpYatf1SPUrE0Aw0OdDQ) - The best way to learn how to write when you can already read.**
- **[Kanken resource page](https://rentry.org/kankenbros/#random-links)** 
- [Chronopolize's Kanji Components](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/390273931) - An Anki deck to help you differentiate similar kanji by teaching components.  
- [Usagi Chan Kanji Phonetics](/kanjiphonetics) - An Anki deck to help you learn the readings of kanji components that carry a consistent on-yomi.  
- [Remembering The Kanji (RTK)](https://mega.nz/folder/SkUABA5Q#4DT43HxP5vZi1pVq44_TVQ)  
- [(Uses RTK) Learn the Kanji](https://www.learnkanji.guide/) - Guide on how to use RTK.  
- [Recognition Remembering The Kanji with less than 450 cards (RRTK)](https://mega.nz/file/2SJiWC4b#hL98qtC_hiLlQDg0LqVJoqD2-5ywT2Nwd4kjROY_KwQ) - Shortened version of RTK.   


### Vocabulary
- [Kaishi 1.5k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1196762551) - The basic vocabulary deck the guide suggests to learn Japanese. You can also find it [here](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases) (click on the `.apkg` file).
- [TheMoeWay Tango N5 Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pMlJvSrKQOSaiN8sPLdNDvWP31EClxDO/view?usp=sharing) - An older deck that was recommended before Kaishi 1.5k was made.  
- [TheMoeWay Tango N4 Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WX9AAKJgiTKN-SySPzuGG8T4nXVhWaSi/view?usp=sharing) - The follow-up deck to Tango N5 above, now superseded by Kaishi 1.5k.
- [Core2.3K VN Order Deck](https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/docs/coredeck/) - The optimized Core deck but ordered in terms of visual novel frequency. Got absorbed into Kaishi 1.5k.

### Grammar
- **[※ - Cure Dolly’s Organic Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj)** - Cure Dolly is a new grammar guide that has sparked recent attention because of its unique way of teaching Japanese grammar. It aims to teach Japanese grammar in a way that sticks true to the roots of the language, in contrast to other grammar guides that take shortcuts that could cause confusion later on. For that reason, I recommend you start with this. Because of Cure Dolly's speech, and the audio quality presented in the videos, you may find it difficult to understand. However there are subtitles available for all videos that may alleviate this issue, which I recommend you turn on. 
- [Cure Dolly Complete Transcript by dinuz UPDATED](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpuXerkGU8waJ4DPDNJA4bGeqOvM-csXjTe57iHARHc/edit) - A complete transcript of Cure Dolly videos. 
- [Tae Kim’s Guide to Japanese, a guide for grammar](https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/taekim.html) - Tae Kim's grammar guide has been around for as long as anyone can remember. It is often recommended as a good grammar guide however you may want to use Cure Dolly instead, for a more optimized approach. 
- [Reference list of all Japanese grammar patterns.](https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/masterreference.html) - Very useful for referring to a point. 
- ["Making Sense of Japanese - What The Textbooks Don't Tell You" by Jay Rubin](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778430038159655012/908722684257501194/Jay_Rubin_-_Making_Sense_of_Japanese__What_the_Textbooks_Dont_Tell_You-Kodansha_USA_2021.epub) - similar to Cure Dolly, it's like the equivalent of the first few videos. It dispells common misconceptions about Japanese grammar people have due to studying Japanese grammar the "traditional" way.
- [NihongoKyoshi JLPT grammar](https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/) - JLPT "grammar" taught in Japanese. I recommend most people learn these *after* Cure Dolly/Tae Kim. You should learn these because many of the grammar points can be easily overlooked when seen in the wild if you don't already know them.
- **[※ - NihongoKyoshi Anki Deck](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778430038159655012/972368473751703572/Nihongo-Kyoshi-complete.apkg)** -  Highly recommended. It only has Japanese definitions, an intentional choice in order to avoid false associations of Japanese grammar with English words.   

Sorry to overwhelm you with information, but also check out my grammar dictionaries for Yomitan (pop up dictionary browser extension). 

## Acquiring Japanese
